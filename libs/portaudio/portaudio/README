We are considering including PortAudio 18 or pre-19 at this place
and building it conditionally.  We cannot use a system-wide
pre-installed PortAudio instead as it never includes PABLIO.

If you want to put portaudio here and reconfigure with
--enable-portaudio=yes
please don't forget to distclean the whole tree and then
to disable the output of libs/portaudio/Makefile in
Epos configure.ac.

This situation is temporary.  (Or it was in April 2005.)
