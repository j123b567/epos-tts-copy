This is Epos, a freely distributable language independent Text-to-Speech
system. See doc/COPYING for distribution conditions.

Compiling on a UNIX machine:

 1. cd src
 2. ./configure
 3. make
 4. make install   (as root - will install cfg files under /usr/lib/epos)

Compiling with Visual C++ on a Windows NT machine:
 0. having inadequate luck throughout is essential
 1. cd arch\win
 2. .\configure.bat
 3. cd ..\..\src
 4. run VC and open the workspace file epos.dsw
 5. build the project (press F7)

Running:
 epos   starts a speech daemon
 say    controls this daemon, e.g. "say 'Some text'" means "tell epos to
	     say 'some text'".

The default configuration speaks Czech using /dev/dsp and the public
TTSCP server at epos.ure.cas.cz. If you don't have /dev/dsp, you might
wish to try "say -w 'Some text'" to create /usr/lib/epos/root/said.wav
which is an MS Windows-style .wav file. If you are not connected to
the Internet, or epos.ure.cas.cz is unreachable or misconfigured (not
unusual), go to /usr/lib/epos/lng/czech/czech.ini and swap the words
"kadlec" and "rvq" in the "voices" option. This will make Epos speak
using a poor quality built-in voice.

More info:

 1. read doc/Intro
 2. read doc/english/epos.* (asterisk stays for any one of txt, dvi...)
 3. browse http://epos.ure.cas.cz/ (mostly identical to (2))
 4. have a look at the files under cfg (or /usr/lib/epos)
 5. read the source under src
(The last two steps are optional.)

Getting help:

 0. The order of the following steps is important.
 1. Download a recent version.
 2. Get more info as outlined above.
 3. mail to epos@braille.mff.cuni.cz. This is a developer list.
    Be sure to mention the version you're running or trying to run
    (to be found in common.h or by "epos -v") and describe your
    problems. If your mail bounces, try geo@ff.cuni.cz instead.
