We just started (spring 2005) providing this FAQ as a supplementary
resource.  If you have a question you haven't found an answer to
here, or any other comment on the FAQ, please send it to
the authors (epos@speech.cz).

If the question is of technical nature, consider subscribing
to the Epos developer list at epos-dev@speech.cz and sending
the question there.  The list language is English.


You don't have to provide the answer, but you can.



Q: What character encoding does Epos expect for text inputs ?
A:
Any number of eight-character encodings simultaneously.
Just download the desired unicode mapping file from
the Unicode consortium and put it into cfg/mappings.
Epos will merge equivalent characters, ignore all characters
which are not assigned any meaning in the configuration
files or rules, and merge the rest into a single internal
8-bit encoding.  Epos will even load additional conversion
tables if a TTSCP connection requests a hereto unused encoding,
and additional characters can be allocated on the fly.  Even this
latter feature may be useful in some rare scenarios, although
normally loading additional conversion tables from TTSCP is
employed just for heterogenous integration.  For example,
the client may run on a different operating system than the
server, and the two operating systems's natural encodings for
a given language may differ.

Epos does not accept multibyte character input
such as UTF-8 as yet.



Q: How do I write my own TTSCP client to do custom processing?
A:
Take <tt>say-epos.cc</tt> as your starting point.  If there are unclear points,
refer to doc/ttscp.sgml (there are make targets there to convert
the documentation to your preferred format).  If the unclear points
persist, please report this as a bug in the TTSCP specification.



Q: How much processing does Epos do before actually starting
to write the waveform to a soundcard?
A:
Roughly speaking, every TTS processor works in several logical stages:

0. text input
1. utterance chunking
2. preprocessing
3. phonetic transcription
4. prosody modelling
5. speech synthesis
6. speech output

With Epos, all these stages are performed sequentially,
and the utterance chunking stage is optional.

That is, all of the input is read into Epos; it is then
split to utterances (sentences); from this point on,
every utterance is processed separately, taking
steps 2 to 6 one by one, possibly in parallel with the
processing of following or unrelated utterances. Therefore,
Epos never speaks out before it has fully processed at least
one sentence of the input text.  It will even process all
of the input text first, unless utterance chunking is enabled
(by including a TTSCP "chunk" module in the processing stream,
note the -u option to the example client).

A limiting factor is step 4, where no current TTS system can
process less than a sentence of text and still have natural prosody.
Some however do have better streaming capabilities, outputting the
speech while it is being sythesized (steps 5 a 6 merged).
This is possible to implement for Epos, too, but as yet the delay
introduced is considered negligible.  (If we do implement this, we
would no longer be able to send fully compliant RIFF headers
over TTSCP, as the length fields remain unknown until the end
of the synthesis step.  That would put additional burden on the clients.)



Q: Will you accept my patch for feature XXXXX and architecture YYYYY?
A:
Yes, as long as it is consistent with Epos.  Consistent roughly means:
compatible licensing, no copy-and-paste stuff, no adverse effects on people
who don't use feature XXXXX nor architecture YYYYY, the same coding
style as in the rest of Epos (see doc/CodingStyle in the Linux Kernel source
for details and some rationale, as far as the C subset of C++ is concerned).



Q: How can I avoid copy-and-paste?  And why should I?
A:
We insist of having every idea at (at most) one point in the source.
The reason is maintainability.  If you are tempted to copy and
edit a block of code, please try to pack it into a new function,
sufficiently general to accommodate both the original functionality
and the one which you seek, and just call it from both places.
You may justly think that this makes the resulting code harder
to read and understand correctly, but the point is that this actually
makes it (almost) impossible to understand incorrectly and modify
inconsistently.  The latter concern is what counts, unless you are
preparing the last patch to Epos forever.
