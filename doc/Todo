Bugs
- decoding and encoding not done for non-text data types (ssif etc.)
- better prosody modelling for monosyllaba
- smooth not implemented
- document [p] and dump
- the --show_labels option is undoc and too idiosyncratic
- theimer is broken
- subst doesn't apply the first time
- assignments to cfg probably do not cow the cfg properly
- fix regress behavior wrt literal zero characters
- sound labels are broken
- say a @b
- -H
- parser discards garbage before the next phone - not always garbage

Features
- pause hierarchy rules
- parsing rules (e.g. for angle/square brackets,
  dots as opposed to periods, dollar signs)
- grammatical marking
- properly cased ordinal numerals
- STML parser
- language dependent options on the server command line
- asynchronous, more robust tcpsyn
- tcpsyn - explicit voice options of local server should be used by the remote
- mbrola
- esd
- Seela database (sp.? German morphology)
- pause/resume in TTSCP
- t i adjustment option
- TCP wrappers & auth config & /etc/epos.users
- reasonable logging
- investigate the optimum pause lengths
- integrate the neural network stuff
- big-endian ovens
- sighup (now no defaults.ini & bugs)

Inventory omissions
- unknown segment - no. 19 (consonant---r)
- missing i/ (?i0) segments, "i" being any vowel, in traditnl.dph
- segment 245 et al. is never used, syllabic r and glottal stops as well
- su.psl et al. missing in kadlec et al.
- cz "euthanasie": missing #eu in lpc
- check whether ptacek97 handles diphtongs correctly

Optimisations
- sync_soundcard() should be replaced with an asyncro thing
- ktdsyn and ptdsyn should not access the filesystem during normal operation
- ptdsyn should also avoid fopen()
- eliminate class connection_lost
- static options (not changeable with setl, not cowed)
- free some option value strings (for the master context and monolith)
- initialiser lists instead of constructor code
- remove code duplication in function.cc

Miscelannea
- QNX port
- make install not robust (cfg not there, no binaries...)
- iso8859-to-cp1250 conversions - get rid of the convertor if possible
- examine the --input_text and --input_file options
- document waveform labels in ttscp.sgml - waveform format description

Should Check
- behavior of intr with something other than oa_wavefm (may miss 123 or 122)
- investigate segment free utterance handling
- load_config skips trailing whitespace in a very strange way
- TTSCP error codes, esp. those related to options and values, should be revised
- what if I change max_line?
