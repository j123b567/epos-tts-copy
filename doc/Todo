Bugs
- stddbg can't handle file sharing, may leak memory
- better prosody modelling for monosyllaba
- we should free some option value strings (for the master context and monolith)
- very long colons crash in occasional colon-wide substitution rules
- ktd reportedly can't stand longer texts
- debug SGML conversions in doc/english; Zdenek (&ecaron); also
  "warning: indent cannot be negative" for some tables in sgml2txt
- the cowing scheme mixes calls to new/delete and malloc/free
  sometimes the con/de-structors are necessary, sometimes must be avoided :-(
- inserting rules (not phones) may go madly looping
  (eating up all memory); why? What should they do anyway?
- make cmd line options for epos, say and eposm consistent: -n, --input_file...
  and document the result
- asyncing - 445 cannot open /dev/dsp  asyncing off - break does not work imm
- lpcsyn::kyu is used before initialised
- problems with longer texts

Miscelannea
