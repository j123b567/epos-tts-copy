Bugs
- stddbg can't handle file sharing, may leak memory
- better prosody modelling for monosyllaba
- we should free some option value strings (for the master context and monolith)
- very long colons crash in occasional colon-wide substitution rules
- make cmd line options for epos, say and eposm consistent: -n, --input_file...
  and document the result
- asyncing - 445 cannot open /dev/dsp  asyncing off - break does not work imm

Features
