Bugs
- better prosody modelling for monosyllaba
- we should free some option value strings (for the master context and monolith)
- very long colons crash in occasional colon-wide substitution rules
- vrfy fails (401 for delh) when the processing is slow (race condition)
- with intr, the 123s do not sum up to 122, because partials are counted twice,
  whereas wave_header never!
- make cmd line options for epos, say and eposm consistent: -n, --input_file...
  and document the result. Also: "say --voiceopt ... --voice ..." works counterintuitively
- set_option can fail, but set the option to a nonsense value

Features
- parsing rules (e.g. for angle/square brackets,
  dots as opposed to periods, dollar signs)
- grammatical marking
- properly cased ordinal numerals
- Roman numerals
- STML parser
- language dependent options on the command line
- asynchronous, more robust tcpsyn
- tcpsyn - explicit voice options of local server should be used by the remote
- mbrola
- esd
- Seela database (sp.? German morphology)
- pause/resume in TTSCP
- t i adjustment option
- TCP wrappers & auth config & /etc/epos.users
- unicode
- waveform cue-points
- reasonable logging
- investigate the optimum pause lengths

Inventory omissions
- unknown diphone - no. 19 (consonant---r)
- missing i/ (?i0) diphones, "i" being any vowel, in traditnl.dph
- silent diphones; pause hierarchy rules
- diphone 245 et al. is never used, syllabic r and glottal stops as well
- su.psl et al. missing in kadlec
- cz "euthanasie": missing #eu in lpc
- check whether ptacek97 handles diphtongs correctly

Optimisations
- ptdsyn and ktdsyn should not access the filesystem during normal operation
- ptdsyn should also avoid fopen()

Miscelannea
- QNX port
- make install not robust (cfg not there, no binaries...)
- iso8859-to-cp1250 conversions - get rid of the convertor if possible
- employ some socket_t and hack const etc. in rx.c to get rid of compiler warnings
