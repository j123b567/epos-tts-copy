
		Files in this package (UNIX)

	Note that the DOS version doesn't contain the "aux", "src" and "dos" 
directories, while src/*.cc, src/*.h, aux/ss.cpp and ss/README.dos are
copied to the base directory. The files may use a different encoding of the
Czech characters (UNIX always uses ISO 8859-2) and have been LF->CRLF converted.

	This file tends to be outdated.

	The files usually located in the "cfg" directory may be moved
elsewhere using ss.ini.

/usr/lib/ss/cfg			various configuration files read by ss
/usr/lib/ss/lng/*		various language specific cfg files
/usr/lib/ss/lng/*/text.txt	random input text to be processed (change in ss.ini)
/usr/lib/ss/lng/czech/nnet.rul	invokes czech.rul, adds some special neural net rules
/usr/lib/ss/cfg/*hdr.txt	printed just before the transcription
/usr/lib/ss/cfg/*ftr.txt	printed following the transcription
/usr/lib/ss/lng/*/*.dic		various corpora of exceptions, used by the current rules
/usr/lib/ss/lng/*/*.dph		descriptions of diphone inventories, used by the rules
/usr/lib/ss/cfg/ssfixed.ini	presumably never-changing (but changeable) parameters
/usr/lib/ss/cfg/ss.ini		presumably often changing tunable parameters
/usr/lib/ss/cfg/ssdeflt.ini	default values (used only in ss_reinit())
/usr/lib/ss/cfg/ssansi.ini	if selected in ssfixed.ini, defines ANSI color output
/usr/lib/ss/cfg/ssrtf.ini	if chosen in ssfixed.ini, defines Rich Text Fmt output
/usr/lib/ss/inv/*/*.ini		diphone inventories
/usr/lib/ss/prosody/*.dic	language independent (rather, default) prosody rules

/var/log/ssdlog		system wide log of TTSCP transactions of the daemon
			(still useful mostly for debugging)

doc			various documentation, mostly both in Czech and English
doc/*/*.doc		the filenames are self-explanatory
doc/Intro		what to read first
doc/Changes		what is new, improved or newly broken in this version
doc/Todo		things I'd add if I knew how and had the time
doc/Files		(this file)
doc/COPYING		the GNU license - legalese and copyleft. Worth reading.

dos			if you do a "make dos" ("make dos1250" etc.), a DOS
dos/ss?-?-?.zip	        	package will show up here

src			C++ source files
src/configure		compilation support (converts Makefile.in to Makefile)
src/Makefile.in		describes the compilation dependencies. Ignore it.
src/Makefile		compilation support (processed by GNU make)
src/*.h			header files, class declarations, enums, #defines etc.
src/*.cc                implementation - each one can compile separately
src/common.h		the main header file, #includes the others
src/defaults.h		some additions to common.h, but used by hash.* as well
src/elements.h (.cc)	unit class (the main structure)
src/nnet.cc		some methods declared in elements.h (neural nets)
src/hash.h     (.cc)	hash tables (fast access dictionaries) (no common.h)
src/parser.h   (.cc)    simpleparser (can parse a typical ASCII input text)
src/rule.h     (.cc)    rules (parses the rules file and calls "unit" methods)
src/block.cc   (.cc)    works together with rule.cc, class block, class rules.
src/interf.h   (.cc)	interface routines	
src/text.h     (.cc)	text file preprocessor (handles #include etc.)
src/synth.h    (.cc)    diphones-to-speech synthesis
...
src/config.cc		list of various runtime options. Gets #included nine times.
src/ss.cc		an example main() code. Not present in a DLL.

aux			things that don't fit elsewhere, scripts et alia
aux/ss.cpp		Borland C++ source file. Compile just this one.
aux/cstodos		script to make a DOS package. Uses cstocs, awk...
aux/tag			script to find a tag in the sources (invoke in "src")
aux/README.dos		how to compile the DOS package
aux/maketgz		script to make a ss?-?-? package on both disk & floppy
aux/makedate		print last modification time of the sources
aux/makever		print the ss version (as #defined in common.h)
aux/makeinst		installs cfg/... to /usr/lib/ss... and more



How does the autoconfiguration work: 

	I. The maintainer edits configure.in and Makefile.in
	   and runs two programs on it before making a package:

configure.in ----(running autoheader)----> config.h.in
        |
        `--------(running autoconf)----> configure


	II. The guy who installs the package runs configure
	    which will adjust the package to his computer:	

Makefile.in --.                           ,----> Makefile
               >----(running configure)--<
config.h.in --'                           `----> config.h


	III. Now you can run "make" and "make install"
	     using the Makefile generated.
