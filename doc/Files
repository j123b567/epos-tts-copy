		Files in this package (UNIX)

	Note that the DOS version doesn't contain the "arch", "src" and "dos" 
directories, while src/*.cc, src/*.h, arch/dos/epos.cpp and arch/dos/README.dos are
copied to the base directory. The files may use a different encoding of the
national characters (UNIX always uses ISO 8859-2) and have been LF->CRLF converted.

	This file tends to be outdated.

	The files usually located in the "cfg" directory may be moved
elsewhere using epos.ini.

/usr/lib/epos/cfg		various global configuration files read by Epos
/usr/lib/epos/lng/*		various language specific cfg files
/usr/lib/epos/voice/*		various voice specific cfg files
/usr/lib/epos/inv/*		various segment inventory stuff, to be installed separately
/usr/lib/epos/lng/*/*.dic	various word lists &c, used by the current rules
/usr/lib/epos/lng/*/*.dp[ht]	descriptions of segment inventories, used by the rules
/usr/lib/epos/cfg/fixed.ini	presumably never-changing (but changeable) parameters
/usr/lib/epos/cfg/epos.ini	presumably often changing tunable parameters
/usr/lib/epos/cfg/default.ini	default values (used only in epos_reinit() - do not change)
/usr/lib/epos/cfg/ansi.ini	if selected in fixed.ini, defines ANSI color output
/usr/lib/epos/cfg/rtf.ini	if chosen in fixed.ini, defines Rich Text Fmt output
/usr/lib/epos/prosody/*		default prosody rules

/var/log/epos		system wide log of TTSCP transactions of the daemon
			(still useful mostly for debugging)

/var/run/epos.pwd	system wide epos supervisor password

doc			various documentation, mostly both in Czech and English
doc/czech/*.doc		incomplete documentation in Czech, plain ASCII text
doc/english/*.sgml	Epos documentation source text in SGML (linuxdoc dtd)
			Type "make epos.dvi", "make epos.html" or "make epos.txt"
			to generate the other documentation formats
doc/english/epos.dvi	complete Epos documentation, nicely typeset
doc/english/epos.txt	complete Epos documentation in plain text (read with "more")
doc/english/epos*.html	complete Epos documentation in HTML
doc/Intro		what to read first
doc/Changes		what is new, improved or newly broken in this version
			how old are the individual features of Epos
doc/Todo		things I'd add/change if I knew how and had the time
doc/Files		(this file)
doc/FAQ			Frequently Asked Questions.  No questions qualified as yet.
doc/COPYING		the GNU license - distribution conditions

dos			if you do a "make dos" ("make dos1250" etc.), a DOS
dos/ep?-?-?.zip	        	package will show up here (obsolete mechanism?)

src/*.cc		C++ source files for Epos and simple clients
src/Makefile.in		describes file dependencies; ignore it
src/common.h		the main header file, #includes the others
src/defaults.h		some additions to common.h, but used by hash.* as well
src/options.lst		list of various runtime options. Gets #included nine times.

arch			things that don't fit elsewhere, scripts et alia
arch/dos		DOS related configuration files
arch/dos/README.dos	how to compile the DOS package
arch/unix		mostly shell scripts; should approx. work on any UNIX OS
arch/unix/makedate	print last modification time of the sources
arch/unix/makever	print the Epos version (as #defined in common.h)
arch/win		MS Windows configuration files
arch/win/configure.bat	run before touching files with the Visual C++ compiler


How does the (UNIX) autoconfiguration stuff work: 

	I. The maintainer updates configure.in and Makefile.in
	   and runs two programs on it before making a package:

acconfig.h ------>---.
                     |
configure.in ----(running autoheader)----> config.h.in
        |
        `--------(running autoconf)----> configure


	II. The user who installs the package runs configure
	    which will adjust the package to his computer:	

Makefile.in --.                           ,----> Makefile
               >----(running configure)--<
config.h.in --'                           `----> config.h


	III. Now it is possible to run "make" and "make install"
	     using the Makefile generated.
