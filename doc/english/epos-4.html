<P>
<P>TTSCP is a connection-oriented, both human- and machine-readable
communication protocol, remotely similar to the File Transfer
Protocol in spirit. It is designed to work atop TCP, but
any reliable connection-oriented underlying protocol
should theoretically work as well.
<P>The server is awaiting new connections on a single TCP port.
There are two types of connections: <EM>control connections</EM>
used to issue commands by the client and to return status
information, such as completion messages by the server,
and <EM>data connections</EM> used to transfer the actual data.
A new connection is treated as a control connection, until
the <CODE>data</CODE> command is issued by the client, causing
it to become a data connection. A <EM>TTSCP session</EM> is a sequence
of commands, their results and referenced data lasting
from setting up the control connection until its disconnection
or the <CODE>data</CODE> command.
<P>Any party may quit the session at any time, but must advise
the other one either by the <CODE>done</CODE> command (the client)
or by a <CODE>600</CODE> response code or higher (the server).
If a <CODE>done</CODE> command is sent before a preceding command
has completed, the server will proceed with the
preceding commands. If a <CODE>600</CODE> or higher error code
is received as a response to a command and subsequent commands
have already been sent by the client, they will not be executed.
<P>A typical TTSCP session looks like this, with client commands
left-indented and server responses right-indented.

<P>
<P>The "user" and "done" commands may become mandatory, the rest may
be freely used between them. For the interaction with a human, the
"help" command is available.
<P>The "brk" command currently stops the speech output for all
the voices. This will change in the future.
<P>It is legal to use "anonymous" instead of the address in the user
command: "user anonymous". It is also legal to switch users
with additional user commands. This may cause context switches.
<P>It is advised to check the greeting string received to begin in 
"preTTSCP" or "TTSCP ". If it doesn't, the client or possibly the
server may be obsolete.
<P>In this document, a "newline" produced by the client should be
a single ASCII LF character, whereas the server should understand
both LF and CR LF sequences as a single "newline". Subject to change.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="formats"></A> <A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Data formats</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>The data is passed between modules in one of the following formats:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> plain ASCII text</LI>
<LI> Spoken Text Markup Language (STML)</LI>
<LI> phonetic structure of the text</LI>
<LI> sequence of diphones</LI>
<LI> waveform file</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Plain ASCII text</H3>

<P>Traditional.
<P>
<H3>STML</H3>

<P>As described in ???. Currently unimplemented.
<P>
<H3>Text structure representation</H3>

<P>Internal text representation, suitable for arbitrary processing, but
unsuitable for input or output. Before output, it must be converted
to another format first. For a description, see the 
<A HREF="epos-2.html#tsr">text structure representation overview</A>.
<P>Conversion to plain ASCII text dismisses prosody.
<P>Conversion to plain ASCII text or STML dismisses diphone layer if any.
<P>
<H3>Sequence of diphones</H3>

<P>
<P>Every diphone is a quadruple of diphone number, assigned frequency (pitch),
intensity (volume) and time factor (speed). The initial diphone is dummy
(to be skipped); its diphone number contains the total number of diphones
in this sequence. The corresponding prosodic parameters are undefined.
They should preferably be zero.
<P>FIXME: endianness, int size considerations
<P>
<H3>Waveform</H3>

<P>The traditional MS Windows <CODE>.wav</CODE> file header and data.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 TTSCP Commands</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>TTSCP commands are newline-terminated strings. Each of them begins
with a command identifier, some of them may continue with optional
or mandatory parameters, depending on the particular command.
Each command generates one or more "replies", the last reply
indicating completion and sometimes also some command-specific
information.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="appl-cmd"></A> appl </H3>

<P>
<P>Apply the current data processing stream (see the 
<A HREF="#strm-cmd">strm command</A>
to some data. The parameter is a decimal number specifying the number
of bytes to be processed.
<P>Before the completion reply, a 122 reply is received by the client.
It is followed by a decimal number on a line by itself, preceded
with a single space. This is the number of bytes written by the output
module. This intermediate reply should be sent as soon as the number
of bytes to be sent is known to the TTSCP server to avoid certain
deadlock scenarios caused by an insufficient buffer capacity between
the server and the client. The number of bytes actually received may
be even smaller in case of a user break or another unexpected situation.
In such cases, the behavior is (still) undefined; assume they never
happen. FIXME: define it.
<P>The completion response code is received when all the modules have
finished processing and data has been output by the output module.
Some of the data may however still be being processed by hardware,
e.g. a sound card, or may be delayed by the network.
<P>Using <CODE>appl</CODE> before the first <CODE>strm</CODE> command is forbidden.
<P>
<H3>brk</H3>

<P>
<P>Stop writing Signal into devices as soon as possible.
(This command may disappear in the future.)
<P>The only mandatory requirement is that there are no more speaking 
processes upon receiving a 2xx error code.
<P>
<H3>data</H3>

<P>
<P>Turn this control connection into a data connection. The parameter,
if any, is the desired connection handle. If no parameter is given,
the server will supply a randomly generated handle.
<P>It is preferred to rely on server generated unique handles,
especially in a networked environment. The client-supplied
handle may be refused if it is already an existing data
connection handle.  A complying server may choose to reserve
some data connection handles for its internal use, to enforce
a certain format for the handles, or to reject all client-supplied
handles altogether.
<P>In reply to a <CODE>data</CODE> command without parameters, at least three lines
are sent by the server. The first is a TTSCP reply announcing the forthcoming
data connection handle (response code 142), immediately followed by the handle
on a line by itself. (The handle is a newline-terminated string consisting
of random alphanumeric, dash, and underline characters, case sensitive.)
The handle is preceded by a single space character, which is not part of the
handle. 
The third line is the completion reply (response code 200 if successful).
After the first newline character following the 200 response code is received,
no more control information will arrive. Likewise, the client may not send any
TTSCP commands after the newline-terminated data command.
<P>In reply to a <CODE>data</CODE> command with a client supplied connection handle,
only the completion reply is received.
<P>If the <CODE>data</CODE> command is not successful, because the handle supplied is
not unique or because of capacity reasons, the connection stays in a valid
TTSCP control connection state and more commands may be submitted.
<P>The data connection becomes valid at receipt of a 200 response code to
this command.
<P>
<H3>delh</H3>

<P>
<P>Terminate a specified data connection. The parameter is the data connection handle
to be terminated, as returned by a former <CODE>data</CODE> command on that connection.
If successful, the connection is disconnected by the server and the data connection
handle is forgotten.
<P>
<H3>done</H3>

<P>
<P>Issued as the last command in a session. The client may exit just
after sending this command. The server should reply with error
code 600.
<P>
<H3>down</H3>

<P>
<P>Stop the server. Quit pending sessions. May disappear in the future.
<P>
<H3>help</H3>

<P>
<P>Request for TTSCP syntax help. The server response is undefined
except for the proper error code termination (class 2 or 4).
<P>Suggested behavior is to reply with "441 help yourself"
or with no more than 24 lines of command resume.
If a parameter is given, the server may supply more 
specific information, such as verbose description of a single
command.
<P>
<H3>pass</H3>

<P>
<P>Attempts to validate an account, as given by a previous "user"
command. If no valid "user" command was ever received, the internal
server password may be used. This may enable some internal commands
such as "reap".
<P>The password format is as yet unspecified. Work in progress.
<P>
<H3>reap</H3>

<P>
<P>Internal implementation only. This command is not required
in any TTSCP implementation. On UNIX, this command is used to
kill a thread specified by a pid given by its parameter.
The session must be validated to UID_SERVER before.
<P>Will be removed in future.
<P>
<H3>say</H3>

<P>
<P>The parameter is a plain text. The server should process it and
write the synthesized waveform to a device as configured.
<P>This command is obsolete and will disappear in the future.
<P>
<H3>set</H3>

<P>
<P>Set a server configuration parameter. The parameter is of the form
"option=value". The server may ignore this command altogether
with an error code 442. In any case, this setting should never
alter the execution environment of existing and/or future sessions.
The server will reply with an error code 412 if the value assigned
is illegal, or with 451 if the server is configured not to allow
to change this parameter (may depend on authentication status).
<P>If the option name is "language", the command will attempt to
switch the language. The same goes for "voice".
<P>The official status of this command is still unclear.  It is definitely
reasonable to use compatible option names between server implementations
where applicable, but the set of useful configuration parameters
is impossible to specify in advance.  Any comment on this issue is welcome.
<P>
<H3>show</H3>

<P>
<P>Show a configuration parameter value. The parameter is an option
name. The server may ignore this command with error code 442.
Subject to change.
<P><CODE>show languages</CODE> and <CODE>show voices</CODE> may be used for listing
available languages, as well as available voices for the current
language.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="strm-cmd"></A> strm </H3>

<P>
<P>Prepare a data flow stream. The parameter is a colon-separated sequence
of data processing modules; commands such as <CODE>appl</CODE> cause specified
data to be run through the modules from left to right.
Any two adjacent modules must be compatible, that is the type of output 
produced by the one to the left must match the type of input processed by the
one to the right. The leftmost module must designate a source (input) module
for the whole stream, the rightmost one must designate a destination
for the data produced by the stream. Information on specific data formats
accepted or produced by the modules can be found 
<A HREF="#formats">above</A>.
<P>The stream is not automatically active. It processes data only when requested
by the 
<A HREF="#appl-cmd">appl</A> command.
<P>The stream lasts until the next strm command or termination of
the TTSCP connection, then it is deleted.
<P>
<H3>Input and output modules</H3>

<P>
<P>The input and output modules follow the same syntax conventions.
If the module name begins with a <CODE>$</CODE>, the rest of the name
is a data connection handle. If it begins with a slash, it is
an absolute file name.  Such absolute file names however form a name
space distinct from that of the underlying system.  In Epos, the
name space is a single directory defined by the <CODE>pseudo_root_dir</CODE>
option.  It must be impossible to escape from the name space by inserting
parent directory references in a file name or otherwise.
<P>
<P>
<P>The output data type of an input module and the input data type of an output
module are determined by the respective adjacent modules. If input and
output modules are directly connected, it is assumed that the data is
a plain text.
<P>Some data types can not be sent or received or only with certain limitations.
This is not too well documented.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3>Processing modules</H3>

<P>
<P>At the moment there are only few modules implemented that do a real 
processing. All of them have fixed names and types.

<P>
<P>
<H3>Explicit data type specifications</H3>

<P>
<P>Sometimes an ambiguity concerning the type of data passed at a certain point
within the stream may occur.  This is currently the case with streams consisting
of input and output modules only (such as a stream to play out an audio icon
from a waveform file to a sound card device); in the future, ambiguously
typed versatile processing modules may be introduced, too.  Sometimes the
data type is semantically irrelevant (for example, a socket-to-socket
forwarding stream), sometimes the default data type, that is, a plain text,
is a reasonable choice.  There are however instances where the type matters,
like copying a waveform file to a sound card device: the waveform header
must be stripped off and the appropriate <CODE>ioctl</CODE>s must be issued to
replay the raw waveform data with the appropriate sampling frequency, sample
size and so on.
<P>The data types can be expressed explicitly by inserting a pseudo-module
into the stream at the ambiguous position.  Failing that, the output data
type of the preceding module and/or the input data type decides the data
type at this point. Failing even that, the server will assume plain text
data.
<P>The pseudo-module name consists of a single letter enclosed in square
brackets.  The following letters represent the available data types:

<P>The data formats are described in

<P>
<H3>trans</H3>

<P>
<P>The parameter is a plain text. The server should process it and
reply with its (phonetic) transcription.
<P>This command is obsolete and will disappear in the future.
<P>
<H3>user</H3>

<P>
<P>Should precede all TTSCP exchanges. Its parameter is "anonymous"
or a local or configured user account name. Some other user names
may acquire special meaning. We'll see.
<P>Unless the account requires no authentication, this command
should be immediately followed by a proper pass command;
otherwise the session may be refused to issue most or all
other commands.
<P>If no <CODE>user</CODE> command is issued, "user anonymous" is assumed.
<P>If the user doesn't exist, anonymous access is granted.
<P>The <CODE>user</CODE> command is still not implemented properly and
its semantics may change.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 response codes</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Any server <EM>reply</EM> contains a numeric code, a single space, and some
arbitrary newline-terminated text. The numeric code (three decimal
digits) allows interfacing with simple to trivial clients, whereas
the text (which is optional) is meant for possible user interaction.
<P>The <EM>response codes</EM> are defined by the protocol, while the accompanying
text is not, but it should rarely exceed 20 characters (clients
should tolerate at least 76 characters plus the response code).
<P>Every response code consists of the <EM>response class</EM>, <EM>the subclass</EM>
and an extra digit. The response class drives the protocol states
and reports errors. The subclass is interpreted depending on the
response class; it can specify which component has reported
an error or generated this particular response. Trivial clients
may ignore this digit altogether. The third digit is merely used
for distinguishing between messages of the same class and subclass
and most clients are likely to ignore it in most situations.
<P>
<H3>response classes</H3>

<P>The response classes listed below are possible within TTSCP.
<P>

<CAPTION>       TTSCP response classes</CAPTION>
</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>
<P>The client is expected to send another command whenever it receives
a 2xx or a 4xx response, not to send otherwise. The client should
treat the connection as terminated, whenever it receives any response
with code 5xx or higher. It may also quit at any time just after
sending a "done" command to the server; the server will however
confirm that command with a reply of 600 before disconnecting.
<P>Replies of 8xx except 800 are reserved for cases of severe server
misconfiguration, or detected programming bugs. Their meanings
are very implementation dependent (implementations are encouraged
not to issue them except in emergency). If such a reply is ever
received, the server has abnormally terminated.
<P>The messages accompanying 3xx and higher response codes are likely
to be interesting to the user if any. Any message without an error
code is a data flow primarily meant for the user if any; a sequence
of these may occur only after some 1xx response, except for debugging
messages if on.
<P>At the moment, some error codes contain letters. Later, all of
them will consist of digits only and will be space-terminated.
<P>
<H3>response subclasses</H3>

<P>
<P>The subclass depends on the response class. The most interesting
classes are 3xx and 4xx, i.e. errors, where the subclass indicates
both the nature of the problem, and the suggested way of dealing
with it (especially in the case of 4xx responses).
The same meaning is attached to these subclasses also in case
of 6xx and 8xx responses.
<P>The middle digit of 1xx and 2xx responses has still no meaning
attached (there are only a few such responses).

<P>The 8xx class of responses (fatal errors) is still very unsettled

will later be removed or merged together. Applications should not try to decode
them except possibly for the middle digit. The same goes for all x6x subclasses
of errors (internal errors)
