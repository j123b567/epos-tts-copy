<P>TTSCP is a client-server connection-oriented,
both human- and machine-readable communication protocol,
remotely similar to the File Transfer Protocol in spirit.
TTSCP is offered as a standard interface for controlling
generic speech processing applications, not only Text-To-Speech ones.
It is primarily designed to run atop TCP, but any reliable
connection-oriented underlying protocol should theoretically
work as well.</P>
<P>The server awaits new connections on a single TCP port.
There are two types of connections: <EM>control connections</EM>
used to issue commands by the client and to return status
information, such as completion messages by the server,
and <EM>data connections</EM> used to transfer the actual data.
Immediately after the underlying connection is opened,
the server transmits a <EM>session header</EM> (see below)
and treats the connection as a control connection, until
the <CODE>data</CODE> command is issued by the client, causing
it to become a data connection.  </P>
<P>Every TTSCP connection (both a control one and a data one) obtains
a connection handle from the server inside the session header.
This handle is a string of alphanumeric characters which
uniquely identifies the connection and which also serves
as an access token for it. Other connections can use such
a handle to interrupt a control connection's task in progress,
to disconnect any connection, to process data received from
a data connection etc.</P>
<P>A <EM>TTSCP session</EM> is a sequence
of commands, their results and referenced data lasting
from setting up the control connection until its disconnection
or the <CODE>data</CODE> command.
Any party may quit the session at any time, but must advise
the other one either by the <CODE>done</CODE> command (the client)
or by a <CODE>600</CODE> response code or higher (the server).
If a <CODE>done</CODE> command is sent before a preceding command
has completed, the server will proceed with the
preceding commands. If a <CODE>600</CODE> or higher error code
is received as a response to a command and subsequent commands
have already been sent by the client, they will not be executed.</P>
<P>A data connection may be silently disconnected by the client
at any time.  To allow reliable disconnection detection by the
server, every data connection is attached to an already
existing control connection (as specified with the <CODE>data</CODE>
command) and it will be automatically disconnected when
the control connection is disconnected.  This attachment relation
doesn't prevent other control connections from referencing this
data connection using its handle, it only limits its lifetime.</P>
<P>The session header (as sent before a TTSCP session starts)
is a sequence of lines terminated with an empty line (two consecutive
linefeed characters with no whitespace intervening).  The first line
shall exactly match the string <CODE>TTSCP spoken here</CODE>; the clients
are strongly encouraged to use this string to identify the protocol.
The following lines, except the terminating (empty) one each contain
a TTSCP header keyword terminated by a colon and a single space
and the value associated with the keyword. The client may choose
not to use these values at all, or to scan only for some header
keywords.  The last keyword in the header shall be the <CODE>handle</CODE>
keyword.</P>
<P>A typical TTSCP session looks like this, with client commands
unindented and server responses indented.</P>

<P>The "user" and "done" commands may become mandatory, the rest may
be freely used between them. For the interaction with a human, the
"help" command is available.</P>
<P>It is legal to use "anonymous" instead of the address in the user
command: "user anonymous". It is also legal to switch users
with additional user commands. This may cause context switches.</P>
<P>It is advised to check the greeting string received to begin in 
"preTTSCP" or "TTSCP ". If it doesn't, the client or possibly the
server may be obsolete or an unrelated protocol may be used at the
port.</P>
<P>In this document, a "newline" produced by the server or the client should be
a <CODE>CR LF</CODE> character sequence.  It is allowed for both parties to
accept a <CODE>LF</CODE> character without a preceding <CODE>CR</CODE> character as a valid
line separator, but it is never legal to rely on this practice.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="epos.html#toc4.1">Session header keywords</A>
</H2>


<P>The set of session header keywords and their sequence may vary between
TTSCP implementations.  Some lower case keywords are defined by this document;
in addition, any implementation may supply its own keywords provided
their first two characters are lower case <CODE>x</CODE> and dash, respectively,
or they consist solely of upper case letters.  Both standard and
implementation specific keywords are limited to upper and lower case
letters (case sensitive), digits, dashes and underlines;
however, the values associated with some keywords may contain any printable
ISO 8859 characters.  There are three mandatory keywords
(<CODE>protocol</CODE>, <CODE>extensions</CODE> and <CODE>handle</CODE>, in order of appearance
in the session header).</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>extensions</B><DD>
<P>The value is a whitespace separated list of semi-standard and non-standard
extensions supported by this TTSCP server.  Only extensions defined by
this document or a future version of this document should be advertised;
custom or experimental extensions may be advertised provided their
first two characters are lower case <CODE>x</CODE> and dash, respectively.
At present, there are no extensions defined, so the list should be empty,
but this keyword is nevertheless mandatory.</P>
<DT><B>handle</B><DD>
<P>The value is a connection handle for this control connection. The handle
stays valid when the connection is turned into a data connection.  Only 
lower and upper case letters, digits, dashes and underlines may occur in
the handle.  This keyword is mandatory and must appear last in the session
header.</P>
<DT><B>protocol</B><DD>
<P>The value is a decimal number identifying the major TTSCP protocol version.
The current protocol version number is <CODE>0</CODE> (previous versions had no
session header).  It is likely that protocol versions unknown to the
client will be fundamentally incompatible.  It is mandatory to begin the
session header with this keyword.  It is recommended to check it on the
client side.</P>
<DT><B>release</B><DD>
<P>Server release.  The formatting and interpretation is implementation dependent.</P>
<DT><B>server</B><DD>
<P>Server name.  Different versions of the same implementation should
typically use an identical value for this keyword.</P>

<H2><A NAME="formats"></A> <A NAME="ss4.2">4.2</A> <A HREF="epos.html#toc4.2">Data formats</A>
</H2>


<P>The data is passed between modules in one of the following formats:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> plain ASCII text</LI>
<LI> Spoken Text Markup Language (STML)</LI>
<LI> phonetic structure of the text</LI>
<LI> sequence of segments</LI>
<LI> waveform file</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Plain ASCII text</H3>

<P>Traditional.</P>

<H3>STML</H3>

<P>As described in ???. Currently unimplemented.</P>

<H3>Text structure representation</H3>

<P>Internal text representation, suitable for arbitrary processing, but
unsuitable for input or output. Before output, it must be converted
to another format first. For a description, see the 
<A HREF="epos-2.html#tsr">text structure representation overview</A>.</P>
<P>Conversion to plain ASCII text dismisses prosody.</P>
<P>Conversion to plain ASCII text or STML dismisses segment layer if any.</P>

<H3>Sequence of segments</H3>


<P>Every segment is a quadruple of segment number, assigned frequency (pitch),
intensity (volume) and time factor (speed). The initial segment is dummy
(to be skipped); its segment number contains the total number of segments
in this sequence. The corresponding prosodic parameters are undefined.
They should preferably be zero.</P>
<P>This format is going to be replaced by a human readable format with
the ability to specify multiple pitch points per segment.  For the time
being, the integer values should be encoded as 32-bit little endian
integers.  </P>

<H3>Waveform</H3>

<P>The traditional MS Windows RIFF <CODE>.wav</CODE> file header and data.
Two liberties may be taken when waveform data in this format is sent
via a data connection.</P>
<P>First, the total length of the RIFF form field
may contain a negative number.  In this case, the length
of the form shall be determined from the data length as indicated
in the corresponding TTSCP control connection.  Also, if this
field contains a positive number, which conflicts with the data
length indicated in the corresponding TTSCP control connection,
the recipient may choose any one of them or return a <CODE>435</CODE> error.</P>
<P>Second, if only <CODE>fmt</CODE> and <CODE>data</CODE> chunks are present in the
RIFF form being sent, and the length of the data chunk is negative,
the length of the <CODE>data</CODE> chunk shall be determined from the
total length of the RIFF form. (Epos never actually takes advantage
of this rule.)</P>
<P>This format allows storing labels (i.e. pointers to specific
positions within the waveform); Epos does use this feature
if enabled e.g. using the
<A HREF="epos-3.html#labelphones-option">label_phones option</A>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3</A> <A HREF="epos.html#toc4.3">TTSCP Commands</A>
</H2>


<P>TTSCP commands are newline-terminated strings. Each of them begins
with a command identifier, some of them may continue with optional
or mandatory parameters, depending on the particular command.
Each command generates one or more "replies", the last reply
indicating completion and sometimes also some command-specific
information.</P>

<H3><A NAME="appl-cmd"></A> <CODE> appl </CODE> </H3>


<P>Apply the current data processing stream (see the 
<A HREF="#strm-cmd">strm command</A>
to some data. The parameter is a decimal number specifying the number
of bytes to be processed.</P>
<P>Before the completion reply, zero or more 122 replies are received
by the client, every one followed by a decimal number on a line
by itself, preceded with a single space. This is the number of
bytes written by the output module per task.  Usually, if the <CODE>appl</CODE>
command generates a single successful task only, there shall be exactly
one such reply, but if e.g. the 
<A HREF="#chunk-mod">chunk</A> module has split the
input text into more independent parts, multiple outputs and
multiple 122 replies may appear; if e.g. the 
<A HREF="#join-mod">join</A> module has
been employed, there may be no 122 reply at all if the text being
processed is considered unterminated.
Such an intermediate reply should be sent as soon as the number
of bytes to be sent is known to the TTSCP server to avoid certain
deadlock scenarios caused by an insufficient buffer capacity between
the server and the client. The number of bytes actually sent may
be even smaller in case of a user break or another unexpected situation;
it shall never be larger and it shall be exactly the number of bytes
sent by the server upon a successful completion reply.</P>
<P>Before the completion reply, one or more 123 replies for every 122 reply
are received
by the client. Every 123 reply is followed by a decimal number
on a line by itself, preceded with a single space.  This is the
number of bytes actually successfully written by the output module.
This intermediate reply should be sent as soon as the data is
sent.  When the client eventually receives a successful completion reply,
the sum of byte counts received with 123 replies shall match
the number of bytes sent by the server.</P>
<P>For every 122 reply, there shall be a corresponding sequence of 123 replies
such that no unrelated 122 or 123 replies intervene.  The sum of byte counts
received with these 123 replies shall match the byte count received with
the 122 reply.  In other words, the replies relating to different subtasks
must preserve the time ordering.  If an error condition prematurely terminates
the <CODE>appl</CODE> command processing, this behavior is not required for
the last subtask whose processing has begun, independent of whether
its 122 reply has been received by the client.</P>
<P>The relative ordering of 122 and 123 replies for the same subtask
is not specified by the TTSCP.</P>
<P>The completion response code is received when all the modules have
finished processing and data has been output by the output module.
Some of the data may however still be being processed by hardware,
e.g. a sound card, or may be delayed by the network.</P>
<P>Using <CODE>appl</CODE> before the first <CODE>strm</CODE> command is forbidden.</P>

<H3><CODE> intr </CODE></H3>


<P>Interrupt a single <CODE>appl</CODE> command in progress. The parameter is a control connection
handle and specifies the connection which issued
the command to be interrupted.</P>
<P>The server should try to discard as much pending data as possible,
including e.g. waveform data already written to a sound card.
If however multiple <CODE>appl</CODE> commands have been sent simultaneously,
only the one in progress will be interrupted.</P>
<P>The server will reply a 401 completion code to the interrupted
connection, whereas a 200 completion code will acknowledge
a successful <CODE>intr</CODE> command.</P>
<P>If there is no stream associated with the connection to be interrupted
or there is no apply command in progress on it, a 423 reply will be
issued to the interrupting connection and the interrupting connection
will not be affected.</P>

<H3><CODE> data </CODE></H3>


<P>Turn this control connection into a data connection. The parameter
is the handle of an existing control connection to attach this connection to.
The sole consequence of this attachment relation is a disconnect of the
data connection when the specified control connection is disconnected.
(It is therefore common for a client to open two connections, to get their
connection handles, to turn one into a data connection and to attach it
to the other connection.  That way the client obtains a control and a data
connection which will gracefully shutdown even after the client abruptly
disconnects.)</P>
<P>The server sends a completion reply for this command (response code 200 if successful).
After the first newline character following the 200 response code is received,
no more control information will arrive. Likewise, the client may not send any
TTSCP commands after the newline-terminated data command.
If the <CODE>data</CODE> command is not successful because of capacity or other reasons,
the connection stays in a valid
TTSCP control connection state and more commands may be submitted.</P>
<P>The data connection becomes valid at receipt of a 200 response code to
this command.</P>

<H3><CODE> delh </CODE></H3>


<P>Terminate a specified data connection. The parameter is the data connection handle
to be terminated, as returned by a former <CODE>data</CODE> command on that connection.
If successful, the connection is disconnected by the server and the data connection
handle is forgotten.</P>

<H3><CODE> done </CODE></H3>


<P>Issued as the last command in a session. The client may exit just
after sending this command. The server should reply with error
code 600.</P>

<H3><CODE> down </CODE></H3>


<P>Stop the server. Quit pending sessions. May disappear in the future.</P>

<H3><CODE> help </CODE></H3>


<P>Request for TTSCP syntax help. The server response is undefined
except for the proper error code termination (class 2 or 4).</P>
<P>Suggested behavior is to reply with "441 help yourself"
or a brief list of commands with explanation.
If a parameter is given, the server may supply more 
specific information, such as verbose description of a single
command.</P>
<P>The usual completion reply rules apply. Specifically, care
must be taken lest the help text contain a line beginning
with a digit.</P>

<H3><CODE> pass </CODE></H3>


<P>Attempts to validate an account, as given by a previous "user"
command. If no valid "user" command was ever received, the internal
server password may be used. This may enable some internal commands
such as "down" or "setg".  (Epos stores this internal password
in /var/run/epos.pwd while it is listening on the standard
TTSCP port.)</P>
<P>The password is a string of alphanumeric characters, dashes and
underlines, no more than 250 bytes long.</P>

<H3><CODE> setg </CODE></H3>


<P>Globally set a server configuration parameter. The parameter is
a whitespace-separated "option value" pair. The server may ignore
this command altogether with an error code 442. The server will
reply with an error code 412 if the value assigned is illegal,
or with 451 if the server is configured not to allow to change
this parameter (may depend on the current authentication status).</P>
<P>The settings, if successful, will apply to all future connections.
They will typically not affect existing connections, unless specified
otherwise. For this reason, this command should be available only
to authenticated and trusted users.</P>
<P>If the option name is "language", the command will attempt to
switch the default language. The same goes for "voice".</P>
<P>The standardization status of this command is still unclear.  It is definitely
reasonable to use compatible option names between server implementations
where applicable, but the set of useful configuration parameters
seems to be impossible to specify in advance.
Any comment on this issue is welcome.</P>

<H3><CODE> setl </CODE></H3>


<P>Set a server configuration parameter. The parameter is a whitespace-separated
"option value" pair. The server may ignore this command altogether
with an error code 442. In any case, this setting should never
alter the execution environment of existing and/or future sessions.
The server will reply with an error code 412 if the value assigned
is illegal, or with 451 if the server is configured not to allow
to change this parameter (may depend on the current authentication status).</P>
<P>The settings apply to the current session; use <CODE>setg</CODE> for more
permanent settings.  Note also that setting some options can have
arbitrary side-effects.</P>
<P>If the option name is "language", the command will attempt to
switch the language. The same goes for "voice".</P>
<P>The standardization status of this command is still unclear.  It is definitely
reasonable to use compatible option names between server implementations
where applicable, but the set of useful configuration parameters
seems to be impossible to specify in advance.
Any comment on this issue is welcome.</P>

<H3><CODE> show </CODE></H3>


<P>Show a configuration parameter value. The parameter is an option
name. The server may reply with the value of the option requested,
preceded by a single space character, or it may ignore this command
with error code 442.</P>
<P><CODE>show languages</CODE> and <CODE>show voices</CODE> may be used for listing
available languages, as well as available voices for the current
language.  The language or voice names are given on separate lines
each.</P>

<H3><A NAME="strm-cmd"></A> <CODE> strm </CODE> </H3>


<P>Prepare a data flow stream. The parameter is a colon-separated sequence
of data processing modules; commands such as <CODE>appl</CODE> cause specified
data to be run through the modules from left to right.
Any two adjacent modules must be compatible, that is the type of output 
produced by the one to the left must match the type of input processed by the
one to the right. The leftmost module must designate a source (input) module
for the whole stream, the rightmost one must designate a destination
for the data produced by the stream. Information on specific data formats
accepted or produced by the modules can be found 
<A HREF="#formats">above</A>.</P>
<P>The stream is not automatically active. It processes data only when requested
by the 
<A HREF="#appl-cmd">appl</A> command.</P>
<P>The stream lasts until the next strm command or termination of
the TTSCP connection, then it is deleted.</P>

<H3><CODE> user </CODE></H3>


<P>The <CODE>user</CODE> command is still not implemented properly and
its semantics may change.  Epos is currently configured
not to need and not to use it.  The tentative theory of
TTSCP authentication goes as follows:</P>
<P>The <CODE>user</CODE> command should precede all TTSCP exchanges. Its parameter is "anonymous"
or a local or configured user account name. Some other user names
may acquire special meaning. We'll see.</P>
<P>Unless the account requires no authentication, this command
should be immediately followed by a proper pass command;
otherwise the session may be refused to issue most or all
other commands.</P>
<P>If no <CODE>user</CODE> command is issued, "user anonymous" is assumed.</P>
<P>If the user doesn't exist, anonymous access is granted.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4</A> <A HREF="epos.html#toc4.4">TTSCP modules</A>
</H2>

<H3>Input and output modules</H3>


<P>The input and output modules follow the same syntax conventions.
If the module name begins with a <CODE>$</CODE>, the rest of the name
is a data connection handle. If it begins with a slash, it is
an absolute file name.  Such absolute file names however form a name
space distinct from that of the underlying operating system.  In Epos, the
name space is a single directory defined by the 
<A HREF="epos-3.html#pseudorootdir-option">&lt;tt/pseudo_root_dir/</A>
option.  It must be impossible to escape from such name space by inserting
parent directory references in a file name or otherwise.  A TTSCP
implementation can decide to reject some or all file input and output modules
with a 454 reply.</P>
<P>If the module name begins with a <CODE>#</CODE>, the rest of the name is a special
input/output module identifier.  The only identifier generally supported is
<CODE>localsound</CODE>, which can only be used as an output module with the <CODE>waveform</CODE>
type.  Any waveform passed to this module should be played over using the
local soundcard.  The <CODE>453</CODE> or <CODE>445</CODE> reply may be issued if the
user is not allowed to use the soundcard, or no local soundcard exists,
respectively.</P>
<P>The output data type of an input module and the input data type of an output
module are determined by the respective adjacent modules. If input and
output modules are directly connected, it is assumed that the data is
a plain text.</P>
<P>The TSR data type can not be sent or received, and may thus be totally
implementation and architecture dependent.</P>



<H3>Processing modules</H3>


<P>At the moment there are only few modules implemented that do a real 
processing. All of them have fixed names and types.</P>

<CAPTION> Available processing modules </CAPTION>
</CENTER><BR>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="chunk-mod"></A> <CODE> chunk </CODE> </H3>


<P>The text is split into parts convenient for latter processing.
These parts usually correspond at least to whole utterances;
it is correct not to split the text at all, but care must be
taken not to cause a split which significantly alters the
final rendering of the text.</P>

<H3><A NAME="join-mod"></A> <CODE> join </CODE> </H3>


<P>It is customary to use the <CODE>join</CODE> module just after a <CODE>chunk</CODE> module.
If this module receives two consecutive texts such that the <CODE>chunk</CODE>
module would not split their concatenation between them, the <CODE>join</CODE> module
may merge them to a single text, that is, it may silently drop the first
subtask and prepend the text to the text acquired later.  This delay
may cross the boundary of an <CODE>appl</CODE> command.</P>

<H3><CODE> raw </CODE> </H3>


<P>The input text is converted in a language dependent way to the TSR,
assuming it is a plain text without any specific TTS escape sequences
or other special formatting conventions.  Except for tokenization
and whitespace reduction the conversion should not try to process
the text, especially not in a language dependent way; this goal
doesn't seem to be always feasible.</P>

<H3><CODE> rules </CODE> </H3>


<P>The voice dependent TTS or other rules are applied to a TSR.</P>

<H3><CODE> print </CODE> </H3>


<P>The TSR is converted to a plain text representation, suitable as a 
user-readable output.  The conversion should be as straightforward
as possible and should not emit any special formatting character
sequences.  Ideally, the successive application of the <CODE>raw</CODE> and
<CODE>print</CODE> modules should not significantly alter the text.</P>

<H3><CODE> diphs </CODE> </H3>


<P>This module extracts the segment layer from the input TSR into
the linear segment stream format; the rest of TSR is discarded.</P>
<P>There may be an implementation-dependent limit on the size
of the segment stream produced.  If more segments should be produced,
the module may emit more subtasks; see the 
<A HREF="#appl-cmd">appl</A> command for discussion concerning subtask reporting.
t</P>

<H3><CODE> synth </CODE> </H3>


<P>The input segment stream is synthesised in a voice dependent way.</P>




<H3>Explicit data type specifiers</H3>


<P>Sometimes an ambiguity concerning the type of data passed at a certain point
within the stream may occur.  This is currently the case with streams consisting
of input and output modules only (such as a stream to play out an audio icon
from a waveform file to a sound card device); in the future, ambiguously
typed versatile processing modules may be introduced, too.  Sometimes the
data type is semantically irrelevant (for example, a socket-to-socket
forwarding stream), sometimes the default data type, that is, a plain text,
is a reasonable choice.  There are however instances where the type matters,
like copying a waveform file to a sound card device: the waveform header
must be stripped off and the appropriate <CODE>ioctl</CODE>s must be issued to
replay the raw waveform data with the appropriate sampling frequency, sample
size and so on.</P>
<P>The data types can be expressed explicitly by inserting a pseudo-module
into the stream at the ambiguous position.  Failing that, the output data
type of the preceding module and/or the input data type decides the data
type at this point. Failing even that, the server will assume plain text
data.</P>
<P>The pseudo-module name consists of a single letter enclosed in square
brackets.  The available data types are indicated by letters listed in
<A HREF="#typespecs">the table of explicit data type specifiers</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5</A> <A HREF="epos.html#toc4.5">Response codes</A>
</H2>


<P>Any server <EM>reply</EM> contains a numeric code, a single space, and some
arbitrary newline-terminated text. The numeric code (three decimal
digits) allows interfacing with simple to trivial clients, whereas
the text (which is optional) is meant for possible user interaction.</P>
<P>The <EM>response codes</EM> are defined by the protocol, while the accompanying
text is not, but it should rarely exceed 20 characters (clients
should tolerate at least 76 characters plus the response code).</P>
<P>Every response code consists of the <EM>response class</EM>, <EM>the subclass</EM>
and an extra digit. The response class drives the protocol states
and reports errors. The subclass is interpreted depending on the
response class; it can specify which component has reported
an error or generated this particular response. Trivial clients
may ignore this digit altogether. The third digit is merely used
for distinguishing between messages of the same class and subclass
and most clients are likely to ignore it in most situations.</P>

<H3>Response classes</H3>

<P>Within TTSCP, nine response classes have been defined.
Out of these, one is used for in-progress communication,
four indicate the results of commands, and the remaining
four are reserved for future extensions.</P>

</P>
<P>The client is expected to send another command whenever it receives
a 2xx or a 4xx response, not to send otherwise. The client should
treat the connection as terminated, whenever it receives any response
with code 5xx or higher. It may also quit at any time just after
sending a "done" command to the server; the server will however
confirm that command with a reply of 600 before disconnecting.</P>
<P>Replies of 8xx except 800 are reserved for cases of severe server
misconfiguration, or detected programming bugs. Their meanings
are very implementation dependent (implementations are encouraged
not to issue them except in emergency). If such a reply is ever
received, the server has abnormally terminated.</P>
<P>The messages accompanying 3xx and higher response codes are likely
to be interesting to the user if there is one. Any message without an error
code is a data flow primarily meant for the user if any; a sequence
of these may occur only after some 1xx response, except for debugging
messages if on.</P>
<P>At the moment, some error codes contain letters. Later, all of
them will consist of digits only and will be space-terminated.</P>

<H3>Response subclasses</H3>


<P>The subclass depends on the response class. The most interesting
classes are 3xx and 4xx, i.e. errors, where the subclass indicates
both the nature of the problem, and the suggested way of dealing
with it (especially in the case of 4xx responses).
The same meaning is attached to these subclasses also in case
of 6xx and 8xx responses.</P>
<P>The middle digit of 1xx and 2xx responses has still no meaning
attached (there are only a few such responses).</P>

<P>The 8xx class of responses (fatal errors) is still very unsettled
and many of the codes listed there
will later be removed or merged together. Applications should not try to decode
them except possibly for the middle digit. The same goes for all x6x subclasses
of errors (internal errors).</P>
