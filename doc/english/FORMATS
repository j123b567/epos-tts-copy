If you have a recent version of sgml-tools installed, you can compile
the documentation into various formats:

make epos.txt		text-only doc, to be viewed with "less"
make epos.dvi		finely typeset doc, to be printed with "dvips"
make epos.html		a hypertext documentation, to be viewed e.g. with "lynx"
make epos.info		GNU info documentation

If you a developer, please make any changes to the original .sgml files only.
