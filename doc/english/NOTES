Necessary changes to the sgml-tools:

(i)   &ecaron; should be understood as an "e" with a caron
	or replaced with just plain "e" in intro.sgml
(ii)  /usr/lib/sgml-tools/dist/fmt_latex2e.pl must not escape
      | at every context. This would break the <tabular ca="...">
      tag.


(maybe maybe not)
