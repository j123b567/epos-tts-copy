Necessary changes to the sgml-tools:

(i)   &ecaron; should be understood as an "e" with a caron
	or replaced with just plain "e" in intro.sgml
(ii)  /usr/lib/sgml-tools/dist/fmt_latex2e.pl must not escape
      | at every context. This would break the <tabular ca="...">
      tag.
(iii) had to \input english.sty (from babel) somewhere, e.g. in linuxdoc.sty
      to avoid "undefined language" errors
(iv)  had to change the &commat; entity handling in
      /usr/lib/entity-map/*/ISOnum.2html
      (translate commat; to a simple @ character instead of &commat;).
      Without this change, the resulting html (almost) does work with
      the lynx browser, but it doesn't work e.g. with Netspace Navigator.
