<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Options</A></H2>

<P>
<P>Most aspects of the operation can be customized by changing options.
This can be enforced by TTSCP commands, in configuration files and
on the command line. Basically, an option is an option name/option value
pair. There are a few possible option types: number, string, yes/no,
character, and a few enumerated types.
<P>Almost all individual options are documented in 
<A HREF="#indivopts">this document</A>. 
The reliable list of all built-in long options can be found in <CODE>src/options.lst</CODE>.
(See approximately line 275 and below. Every line represents at most one
option for every option class as explained below. The option name is
quoted; its semantics is usually explained following the option.)
You can also list their names and types using <CODE>epos -H</CODE>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Option classes</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Basically, there are three major classes of options: global options,
language options and voice options. For instance, switching a voice
means switching to another set of voice options, while the language
options and global options stay the same.
<P>Every voice is language specific (implies a specific language).
That's why switching the language automatically switches the voice
to the voice defined as default for this particular language.
(It is however possible to use the same configuration file to setup
a similarly sounding voice for every language if desired.)
<P>A set of voice options should completely describe a voice.
A set of language options should completely describe a language,
except for voice-specific behavior. A set of global options
should cover language independent aspects of operation.
It should be understood that a set of options may employ various
references to other information, especially filenames (of language
dependent transcription rules, voice dependent diphone inventories
etc.)
<P>Some language and/or voice specific options may have suitable defaults
for all but specific languages/voices. Every voice option thus has its
corresponding language option to default to if unspecified for a given
voice. Likewise, there is a global option for every language option
to default to. Therefore, adding a new language or voice options
doesn't necessarily imply adding them to each language or voice
configuration file, if a reasonable default can be suggested.
<P>Whenever an option name is given, it is first understood as a voice option
(of the current voice); if there is no such voice option, the name
is treated as a language option, then as a global option. To override
this order, you can prefix an option with "C:", "L:" or "V:". This will
restrict the search to global, language or voice options, respectively.
(This is automatically done with configuration files, because every
configuration file describes either a language or a voice, or it is unrelated
to the current language and voice altogether.)
<P>
<H2><A NAME="cfg-files"></A> <A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Configuration files </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Whenever the program starts up, it reads a number of configuration
files, setting up the initial (default) values of the options.
These are typically located under <CODE>/usr/lib/epos</CODE> (can be overridden
with the <CODE>--base_dir</CODE> option on the command line). By convention,
configuration file names have the ".ini" suffix.
<P>Unless overridden, three files in <CODE>/usr/lib/epos/cfg</CODE> will be processed
to setup the global configuration: <CODE>fixed.ini</CODE>, <CODE>epos.ini</CODE> and
either <CODE>ansi.ini</CODE> or <CODE>rtf.ini</CODE> (depending on the preferred
output format if colored output is turned on -- either ANSI escape sequences
or RTF are supported at the moment; other markup formats can be added easily).
By convention, <CODE>fixed.ini</CODE> contains the standard global configuration
values used by a given installation and rarely or never changes, while
<CODE>epos.ini</CODE> contains less permanent parameters and temporary values.
The global parameters include a list of <EM>languages</EM>, or language
configurations which will be parsed when the global configuration is set up.
Every language <CODE>.ini</CODE> file in turn contains a list of voices to be
configured for this particular language. Language configuration files
are located under <CODE>/usr/lib/epos/lng/*/*.ini</CODE>, voice configuration files
under <CODE>/usr/lib/epos/inv/*/*.ini</CODE>, where <CODE>*</CODE> represents any string
listed in the list of languages (or voices for a language). Go see the real
files under <CODE>/usr/lib/epos/cfg/*.ini</CODE> for an example.
<P>If a <CODE>EPOSCFGFILE</CODE> environment variable is set upon the main program startup,
its value is a file name to be parsed instead of <CODE>epos.ini</CODE>.
<P>
<H3>Configuration file format overview</H3>

<P>
<P>A configuration file contains one option per line (empty lines are ignored).
Each option is a name-value pair, separated with whitespace.  A string value
may be (and sometimes must be, e.g. if it begins with whitespace) enclosed
in double quotes.  Every configuration
file is associated with a certain option set, that is, it contains either just
global options, or options related to some language or voice. (In the latter
two cases, the <CODE>name</CODE> option identifies the language or voice properly.)
<P>
<H3><A NAME="escaping"></A> Escaping special characters </H3>

<P>
<P>It is possible to enter some special characters using escape sequences, such
as <CODE>"\ "</CODE> for a space, <CODE>"\n"</CODE> for a newline, or <CODE>"\~"</CODE>
for <CODE>"..."</CODE> or <CODE>"dots"</CODE> (treated as a single character in Epos).
The available escape sequences are listed in 
<A HREF="#escapes">the table of escape sequences</A>.

<P>(If you suspect this table to be out-of-date, you can consult the <CODE>token_esc</CODE>
and <CODE>value_esc</CODE> constants in <CODE>option.cc</CODE>, or the table in 
<CODE>parser.h</CODE>.) ASCII codes in parentheses are ASCII codes used for different
purposes by Epos.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="include-directive"></A> Comments and the &commat;include directive </H3>

<P>
<P>A configuration file usually contains various comments. A comment can start
on any line with a semicolon or hash mark and lasts to the end of line.
The semicolon (or hash mark) must be located at the beginning of line
or just after some whitespace. Semicolons in the middle of a word don't
start a comment.
<P>If a line begins with <CODE>&commat;include</CODE> starting in the first column,
it is treated as the <EM>include directive</EM>.
The format of the line should be <CODE>&commat;include "filename"</CODE> and it will
cause the contents of the <CODE>filename</CODE> file to be inserted at this place of the 
main <CODE>.ini</CODE> file. These includes can be nested to any finite depth; if no or
relative path is specified, the directory which holds the topmost file is used for
the lookup.
<P>Two more directives, <CODE>&commat;warn</CODE> and <CODE>&commat;error</CODE> with obvious semantics
are available for diagnostic purposes.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Command line</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>There are three kinds of command line: the <EM>daemon</EM> one, the <EM>client</EM> one,
and the <EM>monolithic</EM> Epos binary. The following description is a little
bit chaotic in this respect; please do experiment if unsure.
<P>FIXME: see preceding paragraph
<P>In both the daemon and monolithic shape it is possible to override
configuration file supplied values at the command line. All options
may be overridden using <EM>long options</EM>, i.e. the option name
preceded by two dashes and followed by a value (unless the option
is a truth value (boolean) and the value desired is <CODE>true</CODE>
or, for a string option, the empty string).
The ordering of the options on the command line is not significant.
An example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
say --language german --pausing "Wie geht es?" --show_diphones
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This sets the default language to German, enables pausing after each
transformation rule is applied to the text (sets the <CODE>pausing</CODE> option
to <CODE>true</CODE>, in other words) and prints the diphone string generated
in the process (sets the <CODE>show_diphones</CODE> option to <CODE>true</CODE>). The string
to be transcribed and synthesized is given on the command line as well
(it must be quoted unless it consists of a single word).
<P>The list of all available long options together with their types
can be obtained with <CODE>epos -H</CODE> of the main program (not the client
stub, sorry).  The semantics of nearly all individual long options is described
<A HREF="#indivopts">below</A>.
<P>The most frequently used options and occasionally even common sets
of options are given a shortcut, called a <EM>short option</EM>.
A short option is a single letter preceded by a single dash.
Usual conventions for merging short options are available, therefore
the example above may be abbreviated as
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
say --language german -p "Wie geht es?" -d
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>or even 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
say --language german -pd "Wie geht es?"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(There  is no short option for <CODE>--language</CODE>.)
For turning long boolean options off, it is possible to give their name
with three dashes. Therefore,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
say ---show_transcript "Say this, do not show the transcription"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>is equivalent to
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
say --show_transcript off "Say this, do not show the transcription"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A list of (the most of) the short options can be obtained with
<CODE>epos --help</CODE>, or <CODE>epos -h</CODE>.
<P>The options on the command line are processed left to right.
They take precedence over the configuration files (unless
common sense rules otherwise).

<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Setting options in TTSCP</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>See the 
<A HREF="epos-4.html#ttscp">TTSCP specification</A> for general
overview of TTSCP and the <CODE>set</CODE> command.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="allowed-options"></A> <CODE>allowed.ini</CODE> file </H3>

<P>
<P>Setting options in TTSCP can be a security problem, as some options
can cause the server to access unrelated files. It is therefore
strongly recommended not to run the Epos daemon with superuser privileges,
but sometimes more fine-grained access control mechanism is needed.
It is authentication and limiting access to specified options
for some or all users.
<P>By default, all settable parameters can be changed by any outside connection
(this doesn't affect any other connections in any way). 
You can control this privilege by restricting it in <CODE>cfg/allowed.ini</CODE>.
<P>Every line of that file is in the form
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
option_name       access_rights
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <EM>access rights</EM> must be in lowercase and must not contain spaces. They are
a sequence of <CODE>r</CODE>, <CODE>w</CODE>', <CODE>$</CODE> and <CODE>#</CODE>, none of which may be repeated.
Their order is significant, the interpretation is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> if no <CODE>r</CODE> is mentioned, nobody can read the option value</LI>
<LI> if no <CODE>w</CODE> is mentioned, nobody can change the option value</LI>
<LI>  if a <CODE>r</CODE> or <CODE>w</CODE> appears without <CODE>$</CODE> or <CODE>#</CODE> to the left of them,
they grant the read and write rights, respectively, to even
anonymous connections.</LI>
<LI> following $, they grant the respective rights to any authenticated user.</LI>
<LI> following #, they grant the respective rights to the root only.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Semipermanent personal preferences</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>If many users with different needs and aesthetic feelings
share the same Epos daemon installation, they may choose to
place the appropriate TTSCP commands into a file and to point
the <CODE>TTSCP_USER</CODE> environment variable to this file.
The contents of that file will be transmitted by the client
to set up the working environment at the beginning of every 
session.
<P>An example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
set language czech
set voice kadlec
set init_f 90
set init_i 110
set language slovak
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This example will adjust the preferred pitch and volume for a certain
Czech voice; it will also set the default language to Slovak. See
the 
<A HREF="epos-4.html#ttscp">TTSCP specification</A> for more info.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="soft-options"></A> <A NAME="ss3.6">3.6 Soft options </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Most options (discussed until this point) have built-in meanings
and semantics; for most uses this is sufficient and necessary.
However, the user may also decide to define additional options
to be provided by a language to its voices. This mechanism is
called <EM>soft options</EM>; soft options are always voice options
and are described at the language level (that is, the name, type
and default value is supplied with the language, but individual
voices may choose to specify a value for the option).
<P>The soft options are described by the language option <CODE>soft_options</CODE>.
It is a list of colon separated descriptions of individual soft options;
every item is of the format <CODE>name[(type)][=default]</CODE>, where <CODE>name</CODE>
is an arbitrary option name, <CODE>type</CODE> is either <CODE>b</CODE>
or <CODE>s</CODE> (meaning boolean or string; other possibilities include
<CODE>n, c</CODE> for integers and characters, but these are untested
and don't seem to be widely useful. The <CODE>default</CODE> is the default
value to be used if the option is left unspecified by a voice. It should be
chosen as a backward compatible value for a new option if applicable.
<P>The type and/or the default may be left unspecified. The default <CODE>type</CODE> is
boolean, the default <CODE>default</CODE> is an empty string.
<P>An example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        soft_options   "colloquial=false:diphone_listing_file(s)=traditnl.dph"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This example defines two options, a boolean <CODE>colloquial</CODE> and
a string <CODE>diphone_listing_file</CODE>.
<P>The sets of soft options for individual languages are independent and never
clash with each other. However, built-in option names may not be used
as soft option names.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="indivopts"></A> <A NAME="ss3.7">3.7 Selected options </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>To begin with, this subsection is very completely incomplete and can be expected
to grow at a moderate pace just now.
<P>A few individual options will be described in this section.  The rest are either
straightforward or rarely useful. A complete list of options can be obtained
through <CODE>epos -H</CODE> or in <CODE>src/options.lst</CODE>.
<P>The type and the semantic class of the argument is indicated for all individual
options except for truth value (<CODE>on</CODE>/<CODE>off</CODE>) options.  This is because
these options, when found without an argument, are automatically interpreted
as <CODE>on</CODE>. 
<P>Many options may not make any sense to you; indeed, some of them don't
actually make sense to me.  Such options are usually relics from now
forgotten ad hoc configurations.  I appreciate any suggestions on how
to replace any old fashioned configuration mechanisms with more generic
and/or simpler ones.
<P>
<H3>Overall options</H3>

<P>
<P>Some options control overall preferences, strategies and assumptions
to be used by Epos.  Most of them are global booleans.  They are usually
of technical nature and the output produced by Epos should not change
with these options changed, but they can be useful in some special
configurations.  They also get added to resolve some simple software
engineering dilemmata.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>--comma <I>delimiter</I></B><DD><P>This is the delimiter for Epos-generated lists, especially
in TTSCP; an arbitrary string is allowed.  Do not change.
<DT><B>--default_char <I>character</I></B><DD><P>The character to replace any unknown characters in the input text.
See also the <CODE>relax_input</CODE> option.
<DT><B>--end_of_file <I>character</I></B><DD><P>The character to terminate the input text.  This defaults to the
escape character.  The length of the input text is usually
defined externally (by the <CODE>apply</CODE> command within a control
TTSCP connection or by the end of an input), however, there
are cases where this is not applicable or desirable for some
reason.  The character specified by this option terminates
the input text, but not the input stream.  It is also necessary
to press <CODE>Enter</CODE> after the character. Applies only to the
monolithic Epos.
<DT><B>--asyncing</B><DD><P>Turn on to enable asynchronous close() processing. Usable only
on unices; uses fork to delegate the synchronous close()
to a child. This option can be useful for eliminating communication
delays when closing a sound card file descriptor, but it can cause
subsequent references to the same device fail, because the child
still hasn't released the device.  The option has no meaning
on non-UNIX systems, where the close() is always synchronous.
<DT><B>--forking</B><DD><P>Turn on to allow forking and fully detaching the Epos daemon.
Usable only on unices.  If off, some debugging information will
be written to <CODE>stdout</CODE> in some configurations.
<A NAME="ml-option"></A> <DT><B>--markup_language <I>ml</I></B><DD><P>The parameter is either "ansi", "rtf" or "none". This parameter
is only effective in <CODE>fixed.ini</CODE> or on the command
line.  Depending on its value, the <CODE>ansi.ini</CODE> or <CODE>rtf.ini</CODE>
configuration file is appended to the <CODE>fixed.ini</CODE> file during
parsing the configuration.  These two files contain the complete
output formatting information necessary for printing text in
either the ANSI escape sequences (ISO 6429) or the Rich Text
Format; they use colors to distinguish between symbols of different
levels of description.
<DT><B>--memory_low</B><DD><P>Turn on if you're very low on memory. This mode sacrifices speed
for a little bit of saved memory. Basically, turning this on
caused various dictionaries to be discarded whenever the rule
which has used them has been applied and reloaded the next time
it is needed.  Likewise, cached files are released upon the
last <CODE>unclaim</CODE>.  Otherwise these data structures are kept cached
in for the next use.
<DT><B>--paranoid</B><DD><P>With this option on, Epos will tend to detect more errors in
various kinds of input files than without.  It will rather
try to reject suspicious or formally incorrect inputs,
than to do something reasonable with them. Useful for debugging.
<DT><B>--pausing</B><DD><P>With this option on, Epos will pause and wait for a keypress
after every rule is applied.  Of course, this is incompatible
with the <CODE>forking</CODE> option and some other setups.  Should
be only used for debugging.
<DT><B>--ptr_trusted</B><DD><P>One of the checks performed when the 
<A HREF="#trusted-option">trusted</A> option is disabled is checking whether
some pointers are actually pointers, that is, very big numbers
when cast to an integer.  This can be useful on some machines,
but it is absolutely unportable.  It may or may not work with your
compiler; enable this option to skip these checks.
<DT><B>--relax_input</B><DD><P>Turn on in real life situations.  When off, Epos will quit parsing
any text which contains an unknown character (not listed in on of the
<CODE>perm_*</CODE> options).  This option replaces such characters with
the value of the <CODE>default_char</CODE> option before they're classified.
<DT><B>--show_rule</B><DD><P>Print each rule before it is applied.  This is useful mostly for
debugging situations (when a text is parsed in an unexpected way
and the user is trying to find out which rule has escaped his
attention). This option may not work with all setups.
<DT><B>--shriek_art number</B><DD><P>The picture to be printed to <CODE>stdshriek</CODE> in case of an error.
May or may not work.  Small integers such as 0, 1 or 2 are possible.
<A NAME="trusted-option"></A> <DT><B>--trusted</B><DD><P>Code related to the <CODE>class unit</CODE> often calls its <CODE>sanity</CODE> method
to detect any serious structure violation before it makes Epos crash
mysteriously.  In stable versions, however, these checks are unlikely
to be necessary.  Use this option to skip them.
<DT><B>--verbose</B><DD><P>When the rules are dumped with the <CODE>debug</CODE> rule type and this
option is set, all of them will be displayed.  Otherwise only the
current rule is displayed.  That's all.
<P>
<DT><B>--languages <I>list</I></B><DD><P>Lists initially available languages. The parameter is a colon separated
list of language names. Every language must have its associated <CODE>.ini</CODE>
file; the name of the file is obtained by suffixing <CODE>.ini</CODE> to the
language name, while the directory name matches the language name and is
located under the directory as determined by the <CODE>lang_base_dir</CODE>
option.  The first language listed will become the default language.

<H3>Types of output</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>--show_transcript</B><DD><P>Print the transcription of the text processed.
<DT><B>--show_phones</B><DD><P>Print the sequence of sounds generated from the text processed.
<DT><B>--show_diphones</B><DD><P>Print the sequence of diphones generated from the text processed.
<DT><B>--show_raw_diphs</B><DD><P>When used in conjunction with the <CODE>show_diphones</CODE> option, the diphones
will be not only listed by name, but they will also include the actual
numbers generated.
<DT><B>--play_diphones</B><DD><P>Synthesize the waveform and say it through the sound card or write it to
a file, as pointed to by the <CODE>wave_file option</CODE> option.
<DT><B>--wave_header</B><DD><P>When dumping the waveform into a file, put the traditional wav file
header at its beginning.  Regardless of this value, the header
is never added when writing the waveform to a device (a file descriptor
which understands the usual ioctls).
<DT><B>--immed_diphones</B><DD><P>Print the sequence of diphones generated from the text processed
just after the <CODE>diphones</CODE> rule.  This is useful especially
in conjunction with the <CODE>neuronet</CODE> option where the diphone layer
is created, but later to be discarded by the rules.
<DT><B>--neuronet</B><DD><P>Very experimental. See <CODE>doc/czech/nnet.doc</CODE> for more info.
<DT><B>--help</B><DD><P>Print a brief synopsis of short options upon startup.  No data processing
is performed.
<DT><B>--long_help</B><DD><P>Print a list of long options upon startup.  No data processing is performed.
<DT><B>--version</B><DD><P>Print the current version number to <CODE>stdshriek</CODE> upon startup.
</DL>
<P>
<P>
<H3>Text output formatting </H3>

<P>
<P>You can tailor the conventions for printing out processed text quite a lot.
Basically, we're printing out a 
<A HREF="epos-2.html#tsr">text structure representation</A>,
so that we can see what level of description does a character belong to.  Preserving
this information in the output is often very desirable; it can either be done
by inserting delimiters such as custom syllable breaks, or by coloring some levels
of description.
<P>This family of options can result in a quite complex configuration.
That's why we provide at least
two complete sets of settings in <CODE>ansi.ini</CODE> and <CODE>rtf.ini</CODE>. You can use the
<A HREF="#ml-option">markup_language</A> option to switch between them
in  <CODE>fixed.ini</CODE>.
<P>Some options control the colors used for output.  For the time being,
these options actually take the escape sequence needed to switch the
color for the current format (e.g. ANSI escape sequences or RTF).
In principle, other strings than escape sequences can be printed,
but such configuration is discouraged.
<P>Some options configure the appearance of the 
<A HREF="epos-2.html#tsr">TSR</A>
to the user.  The model we use is assigning a few colors consistently
to the individual levels of description and marking up the boundaries

<H3>Limits</H3>

<P>
<P>Most algorithms used in Epos are boundless, avoiding techniques like fixed size
arrays or buffers.  On the other hand, there are instances when this is inadequate,
especially for speed or space considerations.  In these cases Epos tries to
use growable data structures, so that they perform well up to a certain size limit
and then somewhat slower, but still correctly.  We call such a limit a <EM>soft limit</EM>,
as opposed to a <EM>hard limit</EM> which cannot be exceeded.  Most limits in Epos are
configurable and soft, but some hard limits have also been imposed. This subsection
also covers some time vs. space trade-off configuration parameters, though
these are no limits at all. Also some <EM>sanity check limits</EM> are imposed; these
act as hard limits, but can be effectively disabled by setting them to absurdly
high values (and even then they may correctly enforce a certain type of a sanity
check).
<P>In fact, you can ignore this section completely, as the few hard limits tend to
employ absurdly high values. 
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>--diph_buff_size <I>diphones</I></B><DD><P>Soft limit.  Maximum number of diphones generated by the diphoniser
and synthesized at once. It more diphones have to be generated,
they are synthesized in chunks of <CODE>diph_buff_size</CODE>. 
This option has no effect in the monolithic Epos.
<DT><B>--buffer_size <I>bytes</I></B><DD><P>Soft limit. The initial buffer size for a wave file. This value is not
used, if we already know that we will eventually write this waveform
to a sound card device; in this case we use ioctls to find out the size
of its hardware buffer to maximize the chance of getting a smooth
playback.
<DT><B>--dev_text_len <I>bytes</I></B><DD><P>Sanity check limit.  When reading from a device, this is the maximum
amount of data which will be read for processing.  This is not necessary
when reading from a file, because the length of a file can be known in
advance and it is always finite.
<DT><B>--hashes_full <I>percentage</I></B><DD><P>Trade-off. Controls how full should a hash table ideally be.
The hash tables used in Epos
are actually quite robust performance-wise, so that even values
like 1000, that is, ten data items per a hash table slot, result
in reasonable speed. Values somewhere below 100 are the best bet.
<DT><B>--max_line_len <I>characters</I></B><DD><P>Hard limit. Maximum line length in a text-oriented input file.
Longer lines are truncated.
<DT><B>--max_net_cmd <I>characters</I></B><DD><P>Hard limit. Maximum TTSCP command length. TTSCP lines longer
than this will be truncated.  The protocol requires this value
to be at least 80, but a few kilobytes is recommended.
<DT><B>--max_rule_weight <I>weight</I></B><DD><P>Sanity check limit. Maximum rule weight in a choice, as well as the maximum
rule repeat count. Using very large weights can result in memory
exhaustion.  Values on the order of 10000 are still perfectly safe.
<DT><B>--multi_subst <I>count</I></B><DD><P>Sanity check limit.  How may substitutions will be applied to a unit
during processing of a <CODE>subst</CODE> rule.  The rule is applied until
the unit settles down or until this limit is reached.  In the latter
case, the substitution is considered impossible (infinite).
<DT><B>--rules_in_block <I>count</I></B><DD><P>Soft limit. Number of rules used in a block of of rules.
<DT><B>--scratch_size <I>bytes</I></B><DD><P>Hard limit.  Epos uses a temporary internal buffer in a few places.
Usually only very few bytes of the buffer are needed, but overflowing
it is fatal. It is recommended to provide at least a few hundred bytes,
preferably kilobytes, for this buffer.
<DT><B>--variables <I>count</I></B><DD><P>Soft limit. Number of variables used in a set of rules.

<H3>Language dependent configuration</H3>

<P>
<P>This subsection lists some options defined for each language.  Additional
language dependent options are certain directory and file names and possibly
others.  As every voice is associated with a single language (two voices
may share a multilingual diphone inventory if desired), every voice dependent
option is thence language dependent.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>--voices <I>list</I></B><DD><P>Lists initially available voices. The parameter is a colon separated
list of voice names. Every voice must have its associated <CODE>.ini</CODE>
file; the name of the file is obtained by suffixing <CODE>.ini</CODE> to the voice name
while the directory name matches the voice name and is located under
the directory as determined by the per language (default) <CODE>inv_dir</CODE>
option.  The first voice listed will become the default voice for its
language until switched.
<DT><B>--soft_options <I>list</I></B><DD><P>Lists available soft options as described in subsection
<A HREF="#soft-options">soft options</A>.
<DT><B>--fallback_voice <I>voicename</I></B><DD><P>Not used under normal circumstances.  Epos initialises its
synthesis type depended specific structures the first time
it uses a voice.  Should such an initialization fail because
of a network error, the current voice will be switched to
the voice specified by this option and the initialisation will be
retried.
<DT><B>--suppress_side_syll</B><DD><P>This option should be off for most languages.  It makes the
<CODE>syll</CODE> rule avoid splitting off an insufficiently sonorous
word-initial pseudo-syllable. It is an ugly hack originally
introduced to get the Czech syllabification right, but I am
still not aware of related phenomena or possible generalizations.
<DT><B>--limit_side_syll <I>sound</I></B><DD><P>This parameter is only considered if <CODE>suppress_side_syll</CODE> is
enabled.  The parameter is the least permissible sonorous sound
to serve as a sonority peak if it happens to be word-initial.
(More precisely: permissible target unit, scope-initial, as defined
by the individual <CODE>syll</CODE> rule.)
<DT><B>--rules_file <I>filename</I></B><DD><P>The parameter is a filename. The file contains the transformational
rules to be applied for this language.
<DT><B>--perm_* <I>set</I></B><DD><P>The asterisk stands for a symbolic name of a linguistic description
level, such as <CODE>phone</CODE>, <CODE>syll</CODE> or <CODE>word</CODE>.  The parameter
is a simple sequence of all characters belonging to this level
of description. For example, <CODE>perm_phones</CODE> will list letters,
numbers and other segmental symbols.  Punctuation will be assigned
to the higher level sets.  The sets should be disjoint and only the
characters actually processed by the rules should be listed here.
The language independent built-in parser tries to resolve the most
common ambiguities of Latin-based writing systems, like periods.

<DT><B>--name <I>voicename</I></B><DD><P>This option assigns a name to a newly created voice.  If there is no name
specified, this option defaults to the configuration file name (from the
last slash to the nearest dot) the configuration has been loaded from.
The name is then used to refer to the voice in TTSCP.
<DT><B>--type <I>synthtype</I></B><DD><P>The parameter, the speech synthesis type, is one of the following:
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD>

</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>

This option may influence other voice dependent options quite significantly,
as some of them are speech synthesis type dependent.
<DT><B>--remote_server <I>hostname[:port]</I></B><DD><P>If this speech synthesis is of the <CODE>internet</CODE> type,
this option can be used to set the hostname of the remote
server.  If the server is listening on a non-standard port number
(currently the standard port is considered to be 8778), the
host name may be followed by a colon and the port number
requested. This option doesn't affect other synthesis types.
<DT><B>--models <I>filename</I></B><DD><P>The value is a file name. The file contains the diphone inventory
proper. Its format is speech synthesis type dependent.
<DT><B>--counts <I>filename</I></B><DD><P>The value is a file name. The file contains the lengths of individual
diphones in this diphone inventory.
<DT><B>--dph_file <I>filename</I></B><DD><P>The value is a file name. The file contains the diphone descriptions
in the format used by the <CODE>diph</CODE> rule. FIXME: odkaz nebo popis
<DT><B>--dpt_file <I>filename</I></B><DD><P>The value is a file name. The file contains the symbolic diphone names
for user output.
<DT><B>--codebook <I>filename</I></B><DD><P>The value is a file name. The file contains the code book for
the vector quantified LPC speech synthesis (<CODE>lpc-vq</CODE> type only).
<DT><B>--invent_dir <I>dirname</I></B><DD><P>The voice dependent value is a directory name.
The directory shall contain the diphone inventory file (or files)
used by the voice.  The global (default) value at the same time
serves as the base name for looking up newly constructed voices.
<DT><B>--init_f <I>percentage</I></B><DD><P>The auditory neutral integer value for the fundamental frequency.
The typical value is 100.
<DT><B>--init_i <I>percentage</I></B><DD><P>The auditory neutral integer value for the volume.
The typical value is 100.
<DT><B>--init_t <I>percentage</I></B><DD><P>The auditory neutral integer value for the prosodic duration of diphones.
The typical value is 100.  Of course, it is diphone length relative
(some diphones are longer than others), just as the <CODE>init_f</CODE>
and <CODE>init_i</CODE> options are.
<DT><B>--channel <I>channeltype</I></B><DD><P>The parameter, the output channel type, is one of the following:
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD>
<BR>
<CODE>mono</CODE>       </TD><TD> mono output signal </TD></TR><TR><TD>

<CODE>both</CODE>       </TD><TD> stereo output signal, two identical channels</TD></TR><TR><TD>

This option may be used to simulate a dialogue by assigning
different output channels to different speakers.
<DT><B>--inv_sampling_rate <I>Hz</I></B><DD><P>The sampling rate this diphone inventory has been recorded at.
The algorithms we use also imply that we use the same frequency
for the synthesis.
<DT><B>--sample_size <I>bits</I></B><DD><P>Number of bits per sample.  If some kind of a stereo output
is turned on, this option set the number of bits per channel.
Again, this is related to the quality of recording of the
diphone inventory.  We currently only support 8 and 16 bits.

<H3>Prosody generation</H3>

<P>
<P>The options in this section control how the resulting per diphone prosodic
information is assembled from the prosodic adjustments done to the
structural units by the rules.  It actually controls the interpretation
of those adjustments themselves.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>--pros_weight_* <I>weight</I></B><DD><P>The asterisk stands for a symbolic name of a linguistic description
level, such as <CODE>phone</CODE>, <CODE>syll</CODE> or <CODE>word</CODE>.  The parameter
is an integer value primarily used for enabling (1) or disabling (0)
certain levels of description when the total quantities for a diphone
are computed.  It must however be understood that when some rules
like <CODE>smooth</CODE> are applied, the prosodic values are distributed
down to the target level of such a rule and cannot be distinguished
anymore.  If higher values than 1 are set, that will multiply the
prosodic effect assigned to a level correspondingly.
<DT><B>--pros_eff_multiply_*</B><DD><P>The asterisk stands for a single letter, <CODE>f</CODE>, <CODE>i</CODE> or <CODE>t</CODE>,
that is, a prosodic quantity symbol.  This option controls how
are the prosodic values for individual levels of description
combined.  If it is off, they are summed up (taking the corresponding <CODE>pros_neutral_*</CODE>
as the baseline); if it is on, they get multiplied with each other
(again taking <CODE>pros_neutral_*</CODE> as the neutral value). See 
<A HREF="epos-2.html#prosody">prosody modelling</A> for more information and examples.
<DT><B>--pros_neutral_*</B><DD><P>The asterisk stands for a single letter, <CODE>f</CODE>, <CODE>i</CODE> or <CODE>t</CODE>,
that is, a prosodic quantity symbol.  This option controls what
prosodic value is to be considered neutral for use in Epos. The current
configuration file use 100 and prosodic adjustments are essentially
percentages, but a higher value could be used for more fine grained
prosody control (provided the synthesis algorithms can take advantage
of it).

<H3>File naming</H3>

<P>In Epos, most of the files ever opened are located in a single directory tree
(usually <CODE>/usr/lib/epos</CODE>); the files of the same type -- and related
to the same language or voice, if applicable -- are located in the same subdirectory
by default.  Thus, the path name actually used by Epos consists of the base directory
path, the subdirectory (or directory for short) and a relative file name.
This makes it possible to move either the whole configuration structure, or
a specific part of it, or a single file to another place.
<P>The relative file name may contain slashes (directory name separators).
If they only occur in the middle of the name, the file name is still
relative to the directory it would normally
be located in.  However, if the file name begins with a slash or with <CODE>./</CODE>,
the file is treated as absolute or relative to the current working directory
of the Epos process, respectively.  The second case is thus slightly undefined,
but the first one allows to place any file in an arbitrary directory. 
Likewise, if the directory name begins with a slash, it is not considered
to be relative to the base directory.
<P>Changing these options in run time does not immediately cause re-reading the
renamed files.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>--base_dir <I>dirname</I></B><DD><P>The value is an absolute directory name.  This option can be used to
change the location of the whole configuration structure, which can also be

cd src

<P>
<DT><B>--pseudo_root_dir sl/dirname/</B><DD><P>The value is a directory name.  Sets the path prepended
to any file name referenced in the TTSCP 
<A HREF="epos-4.html#strm-cmd">stream command</A>. This subtree cannot be escaped with
cute parent-of-root paths, but you can use symlinks to arbitrary
accessible parts of the kernel name space, again, without
giving access to the rest of the file system. Write access
to this subtree to any user except Epos effectively gives him
the privilege to use the Epos file access rights anywhere
in the system through creating a symlink to the absolute root directory.
<P>

<DT><B>--cfg_file <I>filename</I></B><DD><P>The value is a file name. This option can be used to change the file name
of the <CODE>epos.ini</CODE> file.
<DT><B>--wave_file <I>filename</I></B><DD><P>The value is a file name. This option can be used to change the file name

Epos speak. Other unices don't have <CODE>/dev/dsp</CODE>, however.
<DT><B>--input_file <I>filename</I></B><DD><P>The value is a file name. This option can be used to change the file name

<H3>Debugging options</H3>

<P>
<P>Various kinds of debugging information can be printed by Epos.
The amount and topics of it can be reasonably tuned by a couple
of options.  Most debugging information is printed throughout
the code using the <CODE>DEBUG</CODE> macro; other sources or debugging
information are not discussed in this subsection.  The <CODE>DEBUG</CODE>
macro takes three parameters: the <EM>code area</EM>, the 
<EM>severity level</EM> and the code to be executed if the severity
level supplied is considered sufficient under current settings.
This code is usually a <CODE>fprintf</CODE> to the <CODE>stddbg</CODE> stream.
The decision whether to execute the debugging code, based on the
code area and severity level is carried out by the <CODE>debug_wanted</CODE>
function supplied in <CODE>src/interf.cc</CODE>.  You can either edit
it yourself, or, you can use the options described in this section
to control the behavior of the default <CODE>debug_wanted</CODE> function
supplied by Epos.  Note that <CODE>#define DEBUGGING</CODE> must be
enabled in <CODE>interf.h</CODE>, else the <CODE>DEBUG</CODE> macro is ignored
altogether.
<P>The <I>level</I> argument taken by many options in this subsection 
is a severity level number.

<DT><B>--interf_debug <I>level</I></B><DD><P>Severity level threshold for the "interface" code area;
that is, for assorted (usually) non-member functions, usually
located in <CODE>src/interf.cc</CODE>. This is a catch-all area.
<DT><B>--parser_debug <I>level</I></B><DD><P>Severity level threshold for the code area of parsing
text to yield a 
<A HREF="epos-2.html#tsr">text structure representation</A>.
It nearly coincides with the <CODE>src/parser.cc</CODE> file.
<DT><B>--rules_debug <I>level</I></B><DD><P>Severity level threshold for the code area of
parsing and application of the rules. This usually does
not include any code which is rule type specific.
<DT><B>--split_debug <I>level</I></B><DD><P>Severity level threshold for the code area of most
types of rules, as well as their implementation in the
<CODE>src/unit.cc</CODE> file.  This covers especially
syllabification, diphonization and other structure
manipulations.
<DT><B>--subst_debug <I>level</I></B><DD><P>Severity level threshold for the code area of <CODE>subst</CODE> and
related types of rules, as well as their implementation in the
<CODE>src/unit.cc</CODE> file
<DT><B>--synth_debug <I>level</I></B><DD><P>Severity level threshold for the code area of low level
speech syntheses (diphone to speech). It covers both
individual algorithms and the common code.
<DT><B>--always_debug <I>level</I></B><DD><P>The global positive severity level threshold. Any debugging code
which reaches at least this severity level is executed regardless
of the code area specific threshold. This option is especially useful for
generic debugging, when the code area responsible for incorrect behavior
is still unknown.
<DT><B>--limit_debug <I>level</I></B><DD><P>The global negative severity level threshold. No debugging code
which fails to reach at least this severity level is executed regardless
of the code area specific threshold. This option is useful for setting
up a global severity level threshold for most (non-focused) code areas.
Should the <CODE>always_dbg</CODE> and <CODE>limit_dbg</CODE> options come into conflict,
the former takes precedence.
<DT><B>--focus_debug <I>area</I></B><DD><P>The parameter is a code area to be excepted from the <CODE>limit_dbg</CODE> option.
This code area will obey its own severity level limit, even if the global
negative limit is stricter.  The global positive severity level is however
unaffected.  Every area uses the same name as in its corresponding severity
level threshold option, without the <CODE>_dbg</CODE> suffix.
