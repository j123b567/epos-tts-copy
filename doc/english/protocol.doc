
<sect1>Text-To-Speech Control Protocol  (TTSCP)  (pre-version 1)
<p>

The following commands are used for communication with ssd the daemon.
Any party may quit the session, but must advise the other one.
Every command is given by an example, together with a typical server
response. 

<verb>
	TTSCP spoken here
hello	user@host.domain.net
	3xx user not found
	2xx but go ahead
set option on
	2xx OK
say
	1xx Text OK
	2xx OK
trans Data to transcribe
	1xx Transcription being sent
	...
	2xx OK
done
	600
</verb>

The "hello" and "done" commands may become mandatory, the rest may
be freely used between them. For the interaction with a human, the
"help" command is available.

The "break" command currently stops the speech output for all
the voices. This will change in the future.

It is legal to use "anonymous" instead of the address in the hello
command: "hello anonymous". It is also legal to switch users
with additional hello commands. This may cause context switches.

It is advised to check the greeting string received to begin in 
"preTTSCP" or "TTSCP ". If it doesn't, the client or possibly the
server may be obsolete.

<sect2>commands

<sect3>break
<p>

Stop writing Signal into devices as soon as possible.
(This command may disappear in the future.)

<sect3>done
<p>

Issued as the last command in a session. The client may exit just
after sending this command. The server should reply with error
code 600.

<sect3>hello
<p>

Should precede all TTSCP exchanges. Its parameter is "anonymous"
or a local or configured user account name. Some other user names
may acquire special meaning. We'll see.

Unless the account requires no authentication, this command
should be immediately followed by a proper password command;
otherwise the session may be refused to issue most or all
other commands.

If no hello command is issued, "hello anonymous" is assumed.

The hello command is still not implemented properly and
its semantics may change.

<sect3>help
<p>

Request for TTSCP syntax help. The server response is undefined
except for the proper error code termination (class 2 or 4).

Suggested behaviour is to reply with "442 help yourself"
or with no more than 24 lines of command resume.
If a parameter is given, the server may supply more 
specific information, such as verbose description of a single
command.

<sect3>passwd
<p>

Attempts to validate an account, as given by a previous "hello"
command. If no valid hello command was ever received, the internal
server password may be used. This may enable some internal commands
such as "reap".

The password format is as yet unspecified. Work in progress.

<sect3>reap
<p>

Internal implementation only. This command is not required
in any TTSCP implementation. On UNIX, this command is used to
kill a thread specified by a uid given by its parameter.
The session must be validated to UID_SERVER before.

<sect3>say
<p>

The parameter is a Text. The server should process it and
write the Signal to a device as configured.

<sect3>set
<p>

Set a server configuration parameter. The parameter is of the form
"option=value". The server may ignore this command altogether
with an error code 441. In any case, this setting should never
alter the execution environment of existing and/or future sessions.

If the option name is "language", the command will attempt to
switch the language. The same goes for "voice".

<sect3>show
<p>

Show a configuration parameter value. The parameter is an option
name. The server may ignore this command with error code 441.

<sect3>shutdown
<p>

Stop the server. Quit pending sessions. May disappear in the future.

<sect3>trans
<p>

The parameter is a Text. The server should process it and
reply with a (phonetic) Transcription.




<sect2>response codes
<p>

Still not specified. The following classes are likely to be established:

0xx  reserved  (server queries client?)
1xx  OK, server starts requested transmission
2xx  OK, client should transmit another command
3xx  warning, server still trying
4xx  command failed, client should tx
5xx  reserved
6xx  fatal problem, connection terminated (600 - reply for "done")
7xx  reserved  (server crash with a dump?)
8xx  reserved  (server crash?)

The client is expected to send another command whenever it receives
a 2xx or a 4xx response, not to send otherwise. The client should
treat the connection as terminated, whenever it receives any response
with code 5xx or higher. It may also quit at any time just after
sending a "done" command to the server.

The messages accompanying 3xx and higher response codes are likely
to be interesting to the user if any. Any message without an error
code is a data flow primarily meant for the user if any; a sequence
of these may occur only after some 1xx response, except for debugging
messages if on.

At the moment, some error codes contain letters. Later, all of
them will consist of digits only and will be space-terminated.

111	daemon talks
121	transcription follows
141	option value follows

200	daemon is happy and ready
211	access granted
212	anonymous access granted

360	command ignored (possibly not fully implemented)

411	command not recognized
421	output voice busy
441	no such option
442	help not available

600	session ended normally
690	session terminated because of an old-style error (shriek())

800	server shutting down as requested by client
