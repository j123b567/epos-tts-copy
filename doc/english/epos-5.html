<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Security</A></H2>

<P>
<P>This section just summarizes security features of Epos documented elsewhere
to assist the administrator in setting up a multi-user installation of Epos,
especially in a UNIX-like environment.
<P>Epos can be compiled in two ways; either as a simple monolithic binary
or as a Text-to-Speech Control Protocol server.  For technical reasons
(especially the latency), it is strongly recommended to choose the latter
method for most situations.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 TTSCP-related issues</A>
</H2>

<H3>Authentication</H3>

<P>
<P>TTSCP as such includes support for user name and plain text password
based authentication.  At the moment, Epos doesn't implement any name
space for this authentication mechanism, except for a randomly-generated
server password.  Thus, all connections are either completely anonymous,
or authenticated at the "server" level (which can still be restricted
from setting or reading specific options.)
<P>The server password is stored in <CODE>/var/run/epos.pwd</CODE>.  Any process
with rights sufficient to read this file is able to authenticate as the
server over TTSCP.
For debugging purposes, it is also possible to force Epos to accept
an additional server password with the <CODE>debug_password</CODE> option.
<P>
<H3>TTSCP connection handles</H3>

<P>
<P>In TTSCP, a control connection can issue commands that affect any
other connection (e.g. interrupt a command in progress).  To prevent
malicious use, the handle necessary to refer to a connection is
only available to the connection originator, and is generated at random.
Consequently, privacy in TTSCP relies on the properties of the underlying
network connection and on the length of the data connection handle.
Each byte of handle length carries a perplexity of six bits; reasonable
handle lengths (as controlled with the <CODE>handle_size</CODE> option therefore
fall within the range <CODE>10</CODE> to <CODE>200</CODE>.  Be sure to adjust
<CODE>max_line_len</CODE> as well if using extremely long connection handles.
<P>
<H3><CODE>restr.ini</CODE> file</H3>

<P>
<P>Many TTSCP options are rarely set over TTSCP, and some of them could be
used for malicious ends.  In these cases, the administrator may restrict
their use in the <CODE>restr.ini</CODE> as described in 
<A HREF="epos-3.html#restricted-options">the respective section</A>.  Note especially that unlisted options can
be set freely, and the default <CODE>restr.ini</CODE> file as distributed with Epos
may occasionally omit a slightly dangerous option.  Therefore,
you may want to grep out a list of <EM>all</EM> options and to leave out
only options you're going to treat as necessary for users and harmless
for the server.  On the other hand, almost no options affect the security
directly, because they're only set within the context of the current
TTSCP connection, and the few exceptions are unlikely to have been overlooked.
<P>
<H3>Access to the local sound card</H3>

<P>
<P>At the moment, any TTSCP client is capable of writing arbitrary waveform data
to the local soundcard.  This will change in future versions of Epos,
even if this is not a serious security risk.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Privileged executables</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>It is not recommended to run Epos as a setuid or setgid binary, not because
of a known security weakness, but because of the possibility of yet unknown
bugs.  If necessary, Epos should run setgid to a group with minimal privileges.
<P>Note also that the <CODE>base_dir</CODE> parameter can be given to Epos on the
command-line, thus by-passing the restrictions specified in the <CODE>restr.ini</CODE>
file.  This issue may be solved in later versions of Epos; at the moment
you have to adjust the source manually.
<P>Instead of a privileged executable, run Epos with the desired privileges
at system start-up and use a TTSCP client to control it from then on.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 <CODE>local_only</CODE> option</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>By default, the TTSCP server only binds to the loopback interface.
That way, only local users can see and use Epos.  Turn off the
<CODE>local_only</CODE> option to allow remote users to communicate
with Epos on your machine.
<P>Theoretically, this security measure should not be needed, but it is very simple
and thus likely to reduce the risk caused by bugs hidden in more complex corners of the
Epos TTSCP implementation.
